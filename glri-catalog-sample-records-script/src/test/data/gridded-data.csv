1	Christine Custer	Project	TOPMODEL	Lake	Lake:Lake Michigan	Toxics and AOCs	U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) will identify through this project significant sources and impacts of historical and newly emerging toxics to the Great Lakes ecosystem through broad surveillance as well as laboratory and field research of tree swallows and other bird species.  USGS scientists will determine the amount of exposure to and the effects of historical and emerging contaminants in Great Lakes food chains. The data will inform regulators and provide guidance on removal of Beneficial Use Impairments at Area of Concern sites around the Great Lakes.  Work supported under this project is quantifying exposure to, and effects of, both historical and emerging contaminants on Great Lakes food chains using sentinel indicator species such as colonial waterbirds and tree swallows.  Results will contribute directly to assessments of Great Lakes ecosystem health and science-based decision making, provide data that will be directly used by States and EPA to assess whether specific BUIs can be removed and AOC’s subsequently delisted, provide a baseline for future trend analysis, and determine the effectiveness of recent remediation actions at AOCs and other known hotspots.  The tree swallow data provide for a biological matrix that is consistent across all AOCs and allows direct comparisons among AOCs and comparisons to non-AOC locations across not only the Great Lakes, but also the northern tier of states in the U.S. as well as Canada.  Because swallows can be enticed to nest at AOCs with the use of nest boxes, similar data will be available for all AOCs.  Because there are effects thresholds already established for tree swallows, or other avian species, it can be determined directly whether exposures to contaminants of various chemical classes are at or above levels of concern.  The collection of colonial waterbird data, where those species occur, in conjunction with the tree swallow data, will allow for modeling and assessment of possible contaminant effects throughout the aquatic ecosystem.  The limited feeding radius of swallows and close ties to sediment contamination allow for an assessment of the biological availability of sediment contaminants as well as quantification of changes in sediment contamination that will be directly usable by EPA in remedy effectiveness assessments.

2	Bruce Manny	Data	Water 	Lake	Lake:Lake Erie	Toxics and AOCs	U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists are restoring and enhancing native fish habitat and populations in the Huron-Erie Corridor. A bi-national partnership is identifying, assessing, and prioritizing sites for fish spawning  and nursery habitat restoration to address Beneficial Use Impairments in the Detroit River and St. Clair River Areas of Concern (AOCs). USGS is providing information to help define what constitutes adequate restoration in AOCs.  USGS and partners are measuring restoration success through pre- and post-habitat construction assessments. The purpose of this work is to develop scientifically sound, adaptive management strategies and management tools to restore high fishery productivity in the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers and to provide relevant up-to-date biological information to assist development of delisting criteria for the fish habitat loss Beneficial Use Impairment (BUI) 14. The design and planning work funded by this template aids in our understanding of the natural processes occurring in the system in order to best apply efforts aimed at restoring and enhancing native fish habitat and populations in the Huron-Erie Corridor through multi-agency/organization bi-national partnerships.  Identifying, assessing, and prioritizing sites of natural fish spawning and nursery activity will provide essential information required for future fish spawning habitat construction and potential areas of fish nursery habitat restoration designed to address BUIs in the corridor and help define what constitutes adequate remediation in the AOC. Loss of fish and wildlife habitat is BUI 14 in the St. Clair and Detroit River AOC.  Since 2003, research monitoring and fish spawning habitat construction by the US Geological Survey, in collaboration with the Michigan Sea Grant and 15 other partners, has remediated loss of fish and wildlife habitat in the Detroit River, at Belle Isle and at Fighting Island at a combined cost of $780,000 from US and Canadian sources.  A third fish habitat remediation project by USGS and Michigan Sea Grant, funded by the NOAA Great Lakes Habitat Restoration Program, resulted in construction of 1.25 acres of fish spawning habitat in the Middle Channel of the St. Clair River during the summer of 2012, at a cost of $1,053,000. These three fish spawning habitat remediation projects have increased spawning success of more than 12 native fish species in the Detroit River, including the State- and Provincially-threatened lake sturgeon, and the commercially-valuable lake whitefish and walleye that support fisheries in Lake Erie, worth over $2 billion per year. The purpose and objectives of this research are compatible with the Strategic Vision for the U.S. Geological Survey in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Region (USGS 2000) and the National Fish Habitat Action Plan (www.fishhabitat.org). In 2011, with $100,000 of funding from the USEPA, the USGS modeled where water depth and water flow velocity are suitable for spawning by desirable native fish species, such as lake sturgeon, lake whitefish, and walleye, in the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers (see Bennion and Manny 2011a). This research revealed nine sites in the St. Clair and nine sites in the Detroit Rivers where water depth and flow are theoretically suitable for spawning by these three and other native fish species in these two rivers. Based on selected environmental criteria, the model assumed that these are the most suitable sites for successful spawning by native fish in the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers. Our scientific assessments will measure the increase in fish production at the selected sites, as a result of this fish spawning habitat construction project. Concurrently, geospatial modeling will be conducted by D. Bennion and B. Manny to assess connectivity of St. Clair River fish spawning habitat site to fish nursery habitat in the St Clair and Detroit Rivers, the St. Clair Delta, and Lake St. Clair.

This information is needed  to help prioritize watersheds for restoration, develop strategies to reduce contaminants, and measure the success of those efforts in meeting restoration goals.  The USGS contaminant and virus tributary monitoring network follows the National Monitoring Network for Coastal Waters design. The monitoring effort includes collecting emerging contaminant samples at 17 sites, a subset of the 30 nutrient monitoring sites; and for human viruses and other waterborne pathogen samples at 8 of these 17 sites; using automated, passive, surrogate, and manual sampling. This information will provide baseline information, provide support for measuring restoration progress, and provide potential load change information throughout the Great Lakes.

5	Rip Shively	Data	Soils	Lake	Lake:Lake Ontario	Toxics and AOCs	U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists are conducting long-term tests of acute and chronic toxicity of selected chemicals to important aquatic species in the Great Lakes basin. Task 1a. Examination of the effect of chloride on the acute and chronic toxicity of nitrate using Ceriodaphnia dubia and Hyalella azteca ($108,000 gross funding). It has been well established that increasing chloride concentration in water reduces the toxicity of nitrite (NO2) to invertebrates, including crayfish, amphipods, and midges.  Increased chloride concentrations have also been shown to ameliorate fluoride toxicity to net-spinning caddisflies, and sulfate toxicity to the amphipod Hyalella azteca.  No work has been done to characterize the effects of chloride concentration on nitrate (NO3) toxicity, but anecdotal evidence of an effect may exist in the fact that the chronic effects of NO3 reported for the cladoceran Ceriodaphnia dubia by Scott and Crunkilton (2000: Environ Toxicol Chem 19:2918-2922) using a water with chloride of about 2 to 4 mg/L were observed at concentrations about 14 fold lower than those observed in a recent test conducted at the Illinois Natural History Survey (INHS) using a water with about 34 mg/L chloride.  To develop the most accurate water quality standard possible for NO3, it is necessary to characterize the relationship between ambient chloride concentration and acute and chronic NO3 toxicity.  Toxicity testing will be conducted with C. dubia and H. azteca as test organisms.  Acute NO3 toxicity tests will be conducted with both species at about five different chloride concentrations spanning the natural range of chloride concentrations in surface waters of EPA Region 5.  Chronic NO3 toxicity tests will also be conducted with both organisms using a subset of the chloride concentrations used in the acute tests. Results of this study provide data that could be used by EPA to help develop or refine state standards or national criteria for NO3.  Task 1b. Influence of water hardness on the chronic toxicity of sulfate and chloride to fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) and cladocerans (Ceriodaphnia dubia; $210,000 gross funding). USGS-Columbia has completed a series of acute and chronic sulfate toxicity tests with a variety of test organisms including fathead minnows, cladocerans, mussels, and midge. Results of the study indicate that fathead minnows and cladocerans were the most sensitive test organisms; however, testing was only conducted at one level of water hardness. Similarly, chronic toxicity data for chloride are available for a limited number of species (primarily cladocerans, fathead minnows, and trout). Published studies have documented a protective effect of water hardness on sulfate or chloride toxicity, but these studies have primary been short-term exposures. The objective of this study will be to evaluate influence of three levels of water hardness on the chronic toxicity of sulfate or chloride to fathead minnows in 34-day early life stage exposures and to cladocerans in 7-day exposures. Levels of water hardness to be tested will be selected to be representative of the range of water quality conditions across the Great Lakes. Endpoints to be evaluated will include hatching, survival, length, weight and biomass of fathead minnows, and survival and reproduction of cladocerans. Results of this study will determine if there is an influence of water quality on the chronic toxicity of sulfate or chloride, rather than extrapolating these relationships from toxicity data generated from short-term exposures. Results of this study will provide data that could be used by EPA to help develop or refine state standards or national criteria for sulfate or chloride. Task 1c.

7	Steve Corsi	Project	fish	Watershed	Watershed:Lake Michigan Basin	Toxics and AOCs	USGS scientists will develop support to State partners for the removal of Beneficial Use Impairments (BUIs) such as fish consumption advisories, fish tumor presence, Eutrophication and unwanted algae, drinking water problems, beach health, and concentrations of PCBs in lake trout and walleyes. Areas of Concern (AOC) principles and guidelines were developed as an initial reference point from which appropriate restoration criteria could be developed. Stage 2 Remedial Action Plans (RAPs) were developed for each of these AOCs to address impairments to any one of 14 beneficial uses associated with these areas. Specific remediation actions are completed in order to restore the beneficial use. When monitoring data shows a beneficial use is no longer impaired, the state and EPA can remove that BUI. When data shows all identified beneficial use impairments have been eliminated, the EPA can submit a proposal to the International Joint Commission (IJC) for removing the designation of AOC in its entirety. Specific information and measureable indicators are needed in order to demonstrate restoration of the beneficial use. The USGS will meet with State partners, and others, to develop a scientific framework to support decision needs specific to the AOCs, and when possible across multiple AOCs. This may include: determining appropriate measureable indicators, compilation of existing data and information, defining reference conditions, development of decision support framework, discussion of monitoring needed, etc. The Beneficial Use Impairments (BUIs) where USGS will be most likely to be of help are: fish consumption advisories, fish tumor presence, eutrophication and unwanted algae, drinking water problems, beach health, and concentrations of PCBs in lake trout and walleyes. The other area that we can and are providing support is in assessing new toxic threats.	AOC Decision Support	-90.0086721	44.18934899	TRUE	-93.92944336	41.28080257	-85.88745117	46.99870957
8	Cris Ingersol	Data	TOPMODEL	Watershed	Watershed:Lake Erie Basin	Toxics and AOCs	A number of field studies have shown that mayflies (Ephemeroptera) tend to be more sensitive than other benthic macroinvertebrate taxa to elevated levels of total dissolved solids in streams impacted by mining. Until relatively recently, difficulties with culturing have precluded the use of mayflies as laboratory toxicity testing organisms; however, researchers at Stroud Water Research Center have found parthenogenic species that readily reproduce under laboratory conditions, and researchers at the US EPA EERD laboratory have developed laboratory cultured diets for mayflies that will help to move toward standardization of methods. Recent efforts at the Illinois Natural History Survey built upon these efforts and developed a method for conducting full life-cycle toxicity tests with the mayfly Centroptilum triangulifer using a modification of the EERD laboratory cultured diet. Endpoints for the full life-cycle test included survival to pre-emergent nymph (PEN) stage, number of days to PEN stage, percent emergence, pre-egg-laying live weight, and number of eggs produced. Initial tests were conducted with sodium salts of chloride, sulfate, and nitrate. In acute (96-h) exposures, LC50s for C. triangulifer were approximately one half to two thirds of those generated in our laboratory with Ceriodaphnia dubia. In the full life-cycle chloride test, the most sensitive endpoints were survival to PEN stage, and mean number of days to PEN stage, with a maximum allowable toxicant concentration (MATC) of 267 mg Cl-/L. The fact that major ion toxicity to standard laboratory test organisms like cladocerans, amphipods, and fish, are dependent on the ionic composition of water or an effluent has been well established. Researchers at the US EPA laboratory in Duluth, MN, previously developed statistical models to predict toxicity of high TDS waters to standard test organisms based on ionic composition, and current efforts in that laboratory are aimed at improving the model. It is known that for crustaceans and fish, solutions tend to be more toxic when dominated by particular major ions (i.e., K+, Mg+, HCO3-), and toxicity due to several individual ions, including SO42-, is reduced when solutions contain more than one cation. However, essentially nothing is known about how ionic composition influences responses of C. triangulifer to elevated major ions. Because this mayfly appears to be more sensitive to elevated major ions than other laboratory cultured test organisms, studies with this organism that could contribute to the development of the new ion toxicity model are required.

12	Chris Ingersoll	Publication	Soils	Watershed	Watershed:Lake St. Clair Basin	Toxics and AOCs	Currently, a standard test method does not exist for evaluating the effects of sediment-associated toxicants on freshwater mussels.  A standard guide for conducting water-only laboratory toxicity tests with freshwater mussels was approved in 2006 (ASTM 2008a) and provides a tested and validated, consensus-based methodology for conducting acute or chronic water toxicity tests with the early life stages (glochidia and juveniles) of freshwater mussels.  Several recent peer-reviewed scientific publications have presented data on various toxicants (Bringolf et al. 2007a,b,c; Wang et al. 2007a,b,c) generated with this method and demonstrate consistency and reliability in inter-laboratory (round robin) toxicity tests similar to other aquatic organisms (Wang et al. 2007a).  Because sediments are critical to the existence of an already imperiled mussel fauna, assessing the effects of sediment-associated contaminants and evaluating their quality in a more standard approach would enable more effective protection and conservation.

This is an extension of prior work at the site that has been used by the Manistique River and Harbor Remediation Team (comprised of managers and scientists from USEPA GLNPO, USEPA ORD, NOAA, USACOE, USGS and the state of Michigan) to guide plans for delisting activities. Riparian spiders are important mediators of contaminant flux from aquatic systems to nearby terrestrial habitats.  Aquatic insects accumulate contaminants in their larval form, and transport these contaminants to terrestrial ecosystems in their adult bodies.  Spiders are a key predator of aquatic insects, and many species feed almost exclusively on adult aquatic insects.  Spider concentrations closely track ambient sediment concentrations, making them ideal indicators of ambient sediment concentrations and of ecosystem recovery from sediment remediation.

21	Barry Baldigo	Publication	Citation	Lake	Lake:Lake Superior	Toxics and AOCs	The study will be implemented in two phases due to logistical constraints and the need to incorporate methods developed (and findings) from a comparable investigation underway in another AOC. The first phase will consist of site selection, methods refinement, work-plan development, subcontract assembly, site reconnaissance, and sediment collection which will be done mainly during FY2013. The second phase will consist of macroinvertebrate identification, sediment toxicity testing, data analysis and interpretation, and report preparation and review mainly during FY2014. In brief, we will generate bed sediment toxicity and benthic community data needed to test two related hypotheses that address the two criteria for delisting the benthos BUI. The first hypothesis is that bed sediments at selected sample locations in the AOC are no more toxic to the test species than bed sediments collected from reference (control) sites located outside the AOC. Acute (survival) and chronic (growth) whole bed-sediment toxicity tests will be conducted using the midge (Chironomus dilutus), following standard methods (USEPA 1994; USEPA 2000). The second hypothesis is that the benthic macroinvertebrate communities from targeted sites within the AOC are not significantly different, or are affected (impacted) no more seriously than the communities encountered at reference sites located outside the AOC according to spatial patterns in benthic community composition (nonparametric ordination) and the Biological Assessment Profile (BAP) index and component metrics for Ponar samples collected from soft bed sediments (fig. 1) developed by NY State Department of Environmental Conservation (Bode et al. 2002; Smith et al. 2009). The component metrics of the BAP include: SPP (species richness), HBI (Hilsenhoff Biotic Index), DOM3 (Dominance-3), PMA (Percent Model Affinity), and DIV (species diversity). The mean score of the five indices denotes the overall BAP and associated impact for each site. Although several bed sediment-collection methods are suitable, the Petite Ponar sampler will be used to collect 5 replicate macroinvertebrate-community samples and a single composite sample for bed sediment toxicity tests at each study site. Bed-sediment sizes will be characterized by either the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Sediment Laboratory or NYSDEC subcontract laboratory using a subsample (split) obtained from the composite bed sediment-toxicity sample. Statistical analyses and multivariate (ordination) methods will be used to test the two hypotheses and to determine if the bed sediments within the St. Lawrence River at Massena AOC meet either criterion for delisting the benthos BUI.

23	Richard Whitman	Data	Water 	Lake	Lake:Lake Erie	Toxics and AOCs	Jeorse Park Beach is located in East Chicago, Indiana, within the Grand Calumet River Area of Concern (AOC), which has been identified as having all 14 beneficial use designations impaired, including beach closings.  Jeorse Park Beach has been identified as one of the most highly contaminated beaches in the nation, with annual beach closings due to bacterial contamination as high as 76% in 2010.  Further, beach closings have steadily increased each year since beach monitoring was initiated in 2005 in response to the Beaches Environmental and Coastal Health (BEACH) Act.  Beach closings represent an environmental, social, and economic burden, the alleviation of which require various remediation strategies targeted to specific sources of microbiological contamination. Research by USGS at Jeorse Park Beach in cooperation with the State of Indiana has identified dual factors contributing to beach closings: (1) the enclosed circulation of the beach area prevents contaminants from moving out of the embayment and (2) resident shore birds (geese, gulls) are a significant source of fecal contamination to the swimming water.  In addition to bird contamination, evidence of human sewage contamination has also been found at this beach.  The presence of additional sources of contamination, originating within or outside of the beach, and the influence of beach circulation patterns on retaining and influencing the persistence of these bacteria remain unknown.

25	Cris Ingersol	Project	Simulation	Lake	Lake:Lake Superior	Toxics and AOCs	Elevated concentrations of major ions are associated with a variety of discharges to aquatic ecosystems, including urban wastewater, mountain top removal and valley fill operations, and coal bed methane production. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the toxicity of major ions to aquatic organisms, particularly given the variability of constituents that comprise these effluents. Because the relative toxicity of major ions is highly variable, predicting effects based on conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS) or other composite measures may be simplistic. Furthermore, most of the available information on sensitivity of aquatic organisms to major ions has been derived from short-term laboratory toxicity tests conducted with surrogate species. There is relatively little information on the sensitivity of aquatic insects to elevated major ions. Field studies showed that abundance of mayflies (Ephemeroptera) was significantly lower in streams receiving elevated TDS associated with mountaintop removal and valley fill operations. Based on an extensive survey of central Appalachian streams, the U.S. EPA developed a benchmark for conductivity in areas affected by mountain top and valley fill operations.  However, these analyses have been criticized because of the lack of experimental evidence showing that mayflies and other macroinvertebrates are sensitive to elevated major ions. These experiments will test the hypothesis that elevated levels of major ions will negatively impact benthic macroinvertebrate communities. Experiments will be conducted in stream microcosms to quantify responses of different groups of macroinvertebrates to elevated levels of major ions. The specific ions used in our experiments will be determined after consultation with EPA and USGS researchers.

26	Cris Ingersol	Data	Soils	Lake	Lake:Lake Ontario	Toxics and AOCs	The sensitivity of listed species of fish or amphibians was evaluated in acute and chronic toxicity tests conducted with a range of inorganic or organic chemicals with different toxic modes of action. Results of these studies indicate that the acute or chronic sensitivity of rainbow trout, but not fathead minnow, frequently provided protective acute or chronic toxicity thresholds for most of the listed species evaluated. However, only a limited number of species of sculpins or darters were included in this evaluation, and not all species tested occurred in the Great Lakes watershed. The objective of the proposed study will be to: (1) provide additional chronic toxicity data for sculpins or darters indigenous to the Great Lakes to complement the limited chronic toxicity data for pentachlorophenol (PCP) or copper previously reported for darters or for sculpins and (2) provide acute toxicity data for additional chemicals of concern with sculpins, darters, rainbow trout, and fathead minnow. USGS-Columbia will conduct: (1) acute 4-d and chronic 28-d toxicity tests with PCP and mottled sculpins, (2) acute 4-d and chronic 28-d toxicity tests with copper and PCP with fathead minnows (repeating the Besser et al. 2005 study). If additional funding is provided in FY14, USGS Columbia will conduct acute 4-d and chronic 28-d toxicity tests with copper and PCP with an additional darter species of concern in the Great Lakes. The combined results of the previous and new studies would include 4-d acute and 28-d chronic toxicity data sets for PCP and copper for the following species: rainbow trout, fathead minnow (2X), mottled sculpin, fountain darter, and one additional species of darter from the Great Lakes watershed. Acute toxicity tests will also be conducted with up to about six additional chemicals of concern with sculpins, darters, rainbow trout, and fathead minnows. The number of chemicals tested and the number of species of sculpins or darters tested will be dependent on the availability of early life stages of sculpins or darters. Other taxa might be considered if newly hatched young of the desired species of sculpin or darters cannot be obtained. Selection of the species to be tested will be decided based on a review of the literature and on consultations with USEPA Region 5.

However, the chronic toxicity of organic chemicals has only been evaluated with a limited number of mussel species or for a limited number of organic chemicals. The objective of this study will be to evaluate methods for conducting 90-d water only exposures with juvenile mussels and conducted chronic 28-d toxicity tests with at least organic chemicals of concern and two commonly tested species of mussels (Lampsilis siliquoidea, fatmucket and Villosa iris, rainbow mussel). If additional funding is available in FY14, two additional chemicals will be tested. Selection of the three organic chemicals to be tested will be decided based on a review of the literature, on the results of ongoing acute toxicity testing of mussels and snails at USGS-Columbia with up to 20 chemicals of concern, and on consultations with USEPA Region 5. Candidate organic chemicals might include pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or polychlorinated biphenyls.

28	Cris Ingersol	Project	fish	Watershed	Watershed:Lake Michigan Basin	Toxics and AOCs	USEPA Region 5 previously funded a study in 2011 evaluating the toxicity of nitrogen compounds to a select number of pond-dwelling amphibians. The objective of this new study will be to determine the toxicity of nitrogen compounds to stream-dwelling amphibians. Nitrogen contamination in aquatic systems results from the decomposition of organic matter, as well as through agricultural inputs, sewage effluents and industrial activities. Nitrogen in its various forms is of ecological concern because of its ubiquitous distribution and toxicity to aquatic life. Nitrogen compounds pose a hazard to aquatic larval stages of amphibians, affecting survival and development, and inducing deformities and behavioral impairments. Declines in amphibian populations have been correlated with the prevalence of nitrogen-based fertilizer applications. Chronic toxicity studies conducted with ammonia determined that deformities and delayed development of R. pipiens, B. americanus, and R. clamitans resulted from chronic exposures conducted over the course of larval development to metamorphosis. Uncertainties posed by that study arose from inconsistent dosing as well as high control mortality. Limited testing suggests that water quality criteria for ammonia are likely to be protective of amphibians, yet limited information about the effects of exposure to stream dwelling amphibians and the consequences of sublethal injuries precludes verification.

29	Christine Custer	Data	TOPMODEL	Watershed	Watershed:Lake Erie Basin	Invasive Species	The Des Plaines River, Illinois and Michigan Canal (I&M Canal), and Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal (CSSC) are located within a few hundred feet of each other along about a 20-mile stretch upstream of Lockport, Ill. (see map 1 and map 2). These surface-water bodies unite south of Lockport, Ill. and flow into the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers. Upstream of Summit, Ill. the Des Plaines River diverts to the north toward its headwaters in Wisconsin, whereas north and south of Summit the CSSC receives water from the Calumet and Chicago River systems, which are in hydraulic communication with Lake Michigan. The study area includes the Des Plaines River, CSSC, and I&M Canal, as well as the intervening land area, from Summit, Ill. to the electric fish barrier near Romeoville, Ill., for investigation of the Des Plaines River pathways and southward to Lockport, Ill. for investigation of the I&M Canal pathways (see map 1). In the study area, the Des Plaines River, I&M Canal, and CSSC are separated by fractured-bedrock of Silurian dolomite. Because the CSSC and I&M Canal were formed by excavation into the bedrock, this fractured bedrock and the groundwater it stores and transmits is in direct hydraulic communication with these surface-water bodies in much of the study area (pictured here). An electric fish barrier was erected on the CSSC near Romeoville, Ill., about 6 miles upstream of the confluence with the Des Plaines River, to prevent invasive species that are present in the Mississippi River Basin from entering Lake Michigan, and thereby the rest of the Great Lakes Basin. The principal target of the barrier is the Asian carp. The barrier is not designed to prevent the spread of invasive species into the Des Plaines River. Several flooding events have resulted in water from the Des Plaines River discharging directly into the CSSC at several points upstream of the fish barrier (pictured here), providing a mechanism for the invasive species to bypass the electric fish barrier and move into the Great Lakes. Flooding events reportedly have occurred 1-2 times per year in recent years. In addition, groundwater flow in the fractured bedrock between the Des Plaines River, CSSC, and I&M Canal also provides a potential pathway for the spread of invasive species into the CSSC above the electric fish barrier. Continuous, large-scale bedding-plane fractures enlarged by solution of the carbonate deposits are present in this bedrock unit near the study area (Nicholas and Healey, 1988). In some locations, openings in these fractures up to 2 feet wide have been observed (Environmental Resources Management, 1990). Additionally, these bedrock fractures are bisected by a regular array of near-vertical fractures (joints). These groundwater pathways seemingly could be of sufficient size and interconnectedness to allow the eggs and fry of Asian carp to move into the CSSC from the Des Plaines River and (or) I&M Canal upstream of the electric fish barrier and, thus, ultimately allowing spread of the carp into the Great Lakes.

30	Bruce Manny	Publication	Water 	Watershed	Watershed:Lake Huron Basin	Invasive Species	Asian carp pose an imminent threat to the Great Lakes ecosystem. Current methods of Asian carp control and removal include poison, netting, electro-shocking, and barriers. These methods have had some success in removing a percentage of adult fish but have shown little success in reducing recruitment and overall population size in these systems. Seismic technology has the potential to eradicate invasive species through a range of age classes making it a viable candidate for integrated suppression efforts. The USGS Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center (NOROCK) is assisting USGS Science Centers and other agencies in their efforts to control this aquatic invasive species. Our studies will focus on lethal effects of seismic technology to divert, herd or eradicate invasive Asian carp (silver and bull carp) as a means to inhibit passage and reduce recruitment into additional waterbodies. Initial dose response studies will determine the effects of different sound wave frequencies on various age classes of Asian carp at a range of distances from the sound source. The magnitude of the sound wave and particle velocity will be measured in order to quantify fish response to sound impacts. Initial and delayed lethality will be assessed as well as sub-lethal evading behaviors.

31	Steve Corsi	Project	Streamflow	Watershed	Watershed:Lake Superior Basin	Invasive Species	USACE applies three different types of fish deterrent measures throughout the CAWS. Each measure is designed to prevent a distinct migration pathway of Asian carp toward the Great Lakes.  These measures are: 1) The Bypass Barrier physically blocks known bypasses around the electric barriers that occur during periods of flooding from the Des Plaines River and the Illinois and Michigan (I&M) Canal, and halts possible fish movement through this area. The barriers placed in these locations are intended to stop juvenile and adult Asian carp. Additional and/or more permanent separation measures will be assessed in the Efficacy Study Report; 2) The Electric Barriers create a waterborne, pulsed, direct current, electric field in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal (CSSC), which exposes fish penetrating the electric field to electrical stimuli that act as a deterrent. As fish swim into the field, they feel increasingly uncomfortable. When the sensation is too intense, the fish are either immobilized or deterred from progressing farther into the field. Three barriers (Demo, IIA, and IIB) have been constructed so that two can operate fully at any given time and the third is available for emergencies or planned maintenance shutdown; and 3) Bar screens on sluice gates at Thomas J. O’Brien Lock and Dam were installed to impede entry of Asian carp to Lake Michigan. All potential impacts were considered to ensure public health and safety, and the purposes of these structures must be maintained as authorized by law. USGS scientists will use seismic waterguns to assist fish suppression for USACE during electric barrier planned or emergency maintenance.

32	Rip Shively	Data	Simulation	Watershed	Watershed:Lake Ontario Basin	Invasive Species	Previous work has demonstrated that carbon dioxide gas (CO2), when applied to water, can cause significant behavioral, physical and physiological disturbances for Asian carp, including active avoidance. These results have significant benefits and application to act as a novel, fish barrier to supplement existing electric barriers with a redundant barrier technology.  To date, evidence used to derive these conclusions have come largely from controlled, laboratory experiments performed under stable, ‘ideal’ circumstances. Therefore, despite the promise of CO2 to act as a barrier to control the movement of Asian carp, a number of questions and uncertainties exit regarding it use in real-world scenarios, especially related to efficacy, feasibility, costs, and potential non-target impacts. The overall goal of this project is to quantify the effectiveness and feasibility of using CO2 gas as an Asian carp deterrent using ecologically-relevant scales in real-world scenarios. For this, the ecologically-relevant scale to be used would be an actual, full-sized lock on a waterbody currently used for commercial shipping. A full-scale CO2 barrier at this lock chamber would be developed, implemented and tested. Quantification of barrier effectiveness would be carried out through the use of a telemetry array or remote monitoring (sonar, side-scan technology, etc.) of fishes currently residing downstream of the lock chamber. In addition, collaborations with agencies such as USACE, IL EPA and others would begin to quantify the impacts of target CO2 concentrations on non-target organisms, as well as existing infrastructure.

The Wabash River basin intermittently connects with the Maumee Basin (Lake Erie) through a former glacial channel at Eagle Marsh near Fort Wayne, Ind. during flood stage.  This project collects streamflow and temperature data collection in major streams near Eagle Marsh to provide data to support streamflow and inundation modeling efforts by the Corps of Engineers (USACE).  The work in FY 2012 is composed of two major elements: 1) Operate two existing stage gages at the Asian Carp Barrier Fence in Eagle Marsh for one year to indicate periods when Eagle Marsh floods sufficiently for the adult carp barrier fence to operate and to indicate needs for barrier maintenance and cleaning; and 2) Install two additional hydroacoustic streamflow and temperature gages and operate both for one year on Graham-McCullough Ditch and on Little River or Junk Ditch to establish flow properties to model effect of proposed basin separation on flooding.

The USGS will communicate these results through coordinating site visits at field-scale sites to demonstrate how technologies are applied and production of fact sheets and other publications to share new technologies with stakeholders and managers.  Information will need to be presented in a straightforward manner and detail how to apply the new technology in a field setting. USGS will coordinate the communication approach across multiple projects to most efficiently demonstrate technologies and get the information to the stakeholders and managers.  When possible, USGS will coordinate between multiple control technologies to show complementary capabilities.  As technologies are demonstrated to be effective, eventually this project will move also into a training program to facilitate implementation of these control technologies.  The long-term goal will to be develop field sites where multiple technologies can be evaluated over time, including developing infrastructure, where needed, at these field sites to support this mission.

36	Cris Ingersol	Publication	Rivermouth	Channel	Channel:Detroit Channel	Invasive Species	Piscivorous birds readily consume Asian carp (AC) in areas where the AC population is high, particularly downstream of the CAWS or in the Des Plaines River, and can easily move between these systems and locations upstream of the dispersion barrier on the CAWS. Dead silver carp have also been observed on the decks of barges moving throughout the CAWS, including upstream through the dispersion barrier. Both sources (piscivorous birds and carcasses) are potential vectors of AC DNA. The goals of this research are to evaluate the potential that: 1) piscivorous birds and 2) carcasses are sources of AC DNA in environmental DNA (eDNA) samples. This project is part of a much larger project that is evaluating several potential vectors of AC eDNA. The U.S. Geological Survey Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center (UMESC) will determine whether AC DNA passes through the digestive system of piscivorous birds in a form that is detectable through standard eDNA monitoring protocols. Piscivorous birds will be retained in enclosed ponds and fed diets containing fresh AC. Fecal material will be collected, DNA extracted and subsequently analyzed for the presence of AC DNA. Water samples will be collected from the holding pond(s) prior to the addition of the birds, immediately after adding the birds, and then weekly after feeding begins. All water samples will be processed according to a standard eDNA protocol to determine the presence/absence of AC eDNA.

37	Cecil Jennings	Data	Radiation	Channel	Channel:Niagara Channel	Invasive Species	Bluegreen algae (primarily Microcystis sp.) blooms resulting from the mussel invasion may provide an excellent food source for bighead carp, enhancing their invasion. Noxious bluegreen algal blooms, under some circumstances, can be enhanced by interaction with silver and bighead carp, and presence of these carp may enhance toxin production by noxious algae. USGS hired the necessary personnel and obtained permits for laboratory work. Work also began to culture the bluegreen algae and construction of the tank to house and feed Asian carp. In this second year of the project, the project will be expanded to outdoor water enclosures to accommodate larger fish than those used in the first year of the project. It is not anticipated that the laboratory work with small fish will be completed for both species in the first year; therefore, some work with small silver carp (especially the bioenergetics portion) will be finished in 2012. USGS will also purchase and setup of water enclosures.	Assessing Risks of Great Lakes Invasion by Understanding Asian Carp and Bluegreen Algae Dynamics	-94.588	45.481	TRUE	-95.02	44.998	-94.06	45.872
38	Nile Kemble	Project	Ventilation	Channel	Channel:St. Clair/Detroit River System	Invasive Species	Silver carp and bighead carp, two invasive Asian carp species, have become established in the Mississippi River watershed, and there is potential for these fish to invade the Great Lakes waters in the near future. Currently, prevention of the movement of Asian carp from the Mississippi watershed into the Great Lakes rests on a set of electric barriers installed in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal (CSSC). Additional barriers and/or supplements to the electric barrier would improve the efficacy of deterring Asian carp movement into the Great Lakes and elsewhere. Seismic technologies used in oil exploration create high pressure underwater sound energy waves that may deter the movement of Asian carp. These sound energy waves may be produced by a variety of means ranging from chemical explosives to high pressure air. Two pneumatic techniques, both involving high pressure air, are the air guns and water guns. Air guns release on command a specified volume of high-pressure air which produces a steep-fronted shock wave with several oscillations caused by the repeated collapse and expansion of the air bubble. Water guns use high pressure air to drive a shuttle through the lower chamber of the water gun. The rapid expulsion of the water in the lower chamber by the shuttle creates a void which is rapidly filled by the collapse of water back into the void – the collapse of water into this void creates a pulsed sound energy or pressure wave whose frequencies range from 20 to 1,500 Hz. Seismic technologies employed as a barrier could deter movement of or drive Asian carp from an area, effectively supplementing existing barriers or by providing a standalone deterrent in other locations (e.g., locks, connecting waterways, etc.). Prior to deploying seismic water guns in the CSSC to prevent movement of Asian carp past critical points, it is crucial that the effectiveness of this technology to either repel or damage carp in the field be demonstrated conclusively. Behavioral responses of several fish species to seismic surveys in marine environments suggest that seismic survey gear (e.g., air guns) cause increased fish movement (as evidenced by greater catch rates of marine fishes in gillnets [a gear which required fish to encounter it]) and decreased feeding (as evidenced by decreased catch using long line sets [a gear which requires active feeding] and decreased stomach contents). Movement response appears to vary with the habitat preference of the species - marine species using essentially featureless habitats were reported to have greater dispersal responses to seismic survey technologies than species that inhabit more specific “rough” bottom habitats. If freshwater pelagic species like bighead carp and silver carp respond similarly to marine pelagic fishes then the water gun discharge may cause them to disperse in response to the sound/pressure pulse generated from water gun discharge. Methods now available to control nuisance and non‐native, invasive fishes are inadequate. Some methods are expensive, labor intensive, and non‐selective, or length specific. Proximity of Asian carp (bighead carp and silver carp) to the Great Lakes Basin highlights the need to make quickly available additional control methods to affect their behavior, thereby impeding their spread into the Great Lakes, or to remove Asian carp through direct mortality. Seismic technology has the potential to affect the behavior or eradicate nuisance and non‐native invasive fishes through a range of age classes, making it a viable candidate for integrated suppression efforts.

Although toxicity information is generally not available for these new compounds in aquatic organisms, structure activity relationship analysis could identify likely candidates for inclusion in a toxicant screening program. Action: USGS will develop cooperative research and development agreements to access pharmaceutical or agrochemical company chemical libraries to identify potential candidate toxicants. Identification of potential toxicants will either be through structure activity relationships or through known activity models. Studies will be required to assess selective toxicity of candidate toxicants between Asian carp versus native fishes. Additional data sets would be required to support registration.

Current physical controls (e.g., electrofishing or netting) are of limited success in altering populations. The development of physical methods to disrupt Asian carp spawning activities in identified tributaries coupled with attractant pheromones has the potential to limit Asian carp reproduction success. Much of the work pertaining to this project was not expected to begin until FY 2011. USGS hired the personnel to carry out the activities for the project and initiated the process for collaboration with Purdue to assist with project activities.  Under this task, USGS will conduct the following: 1) Refine test system for running electrical current and sonication exposure trials to further evaluate the response of Asian carp eggs; 2) Conduct full suite of electrical current and sonication experiments to determine effects on early life history stages of Asian carp; 3) Determine whether electrical current and sonication exposures increase sensitivity of carp on early life history stages to chemical control measures; 4) Evaluate potential for large-scale implementation of physical disruption; and 5) Produce a final report and peer-reviewed articles.

41	James Morris	Project	Airation	Lake	Lake:Lake Huron	Invasive Species	Current toxicants used to control AIS are non-selective and applied throughout the entire water column, resulting in equal exposures of native and invasive species to the toxicant. Development of a delivery system that is selectively consumed by or active in an invasive species could reduce non-target species exposure to the toxicant and may enhance selectivity and reduce effects to non-target species. Development of such delivery methodologies will require full understanding of native and invasive species gill and gut enzyme activity and physiology, because a targeted delivery system will likely use an oral or gill adhesion delivery route. Tasks completed in 2010 included the literature review, native planktivore selection to study their gastroinintestinal system, creating the Real Time – Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) protocol for gene sequence, creating field testing protocols, and sampling of planktivore digestive track. Research will be conducted to identify and characterize potential bioactive agent delivery sites within native fishes, especially those with potential dietary or other life history overlap with bighead and silver carp, including the gill, skin, and gastrointestinal tract. Research will focus on acquisition of data on important characteristics of native species (e.g., enzyme, protein, lipid, carbohydrate components, pH, and enteric microbial community).

42	Kurt Kowalski	Publication	Citation	Lake	Lake:Lake Superior	Invasive Species	U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) will conduct studies to  test new strategies to reduce the invasive properties of Phragmites and minimize its competitive advantage.   Phragmites, an invasive wetland plant, continues to spread throughout the Great Lakes.  This plant inhibits natural coastal functions such as nursery areas for critical fish and wildlife habitat and it blocks valuable lake views.  The current control strategies are time, labor, and resource intensive, so innovative methods to control the spread of Phragmites or minimize its invasive properties are needed.  The invasive form of Phragmites is a well-established pest in many parts of the Great Lakes and the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts, including Areas of Concern (AOC).  It is currently managed using a suite of resource-intensive methods including manipulating water levels, applying herbicides, mowing/disking, and burning.  Although new biological control options (i.e., insects) are being developed, conventional management tools being used now are unsustainable because of their time- and resource-intensive nature (i.e., expensive repeated applications are required).  A similar situation exists for many other invasive plants (i.e., pests) across the nation, so new innovative control options that sustainably target the competitive advantage often enjoyed by invasive plants will contribute to a broad Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategy.  IPM involves a coordinated application of methods to minimize pest damage using the least hazardous and most efficient means possible.  It involves examination of the pest and environmental conditions during the many phases of invasion or establishment (e.g., prevention, monitoring and mapping distribution, biology, best management practices, building partnerships among stakeholders, evaluating results of management strategies).  This project targets the organisms that may help Phragmites spread and will employ a molecular genetic approach to silence the genes in Phragmites that allow it to reproduce and grow.  Finally, this project focuses on the people side of Phragmites IPM, including building partnerships among stakeholders, evaluating results of control efforts, and feeding information back into the adaptive management process. Phase 1 of the project (i.e., FY 2010 - 2012) was focused on developing sustainable invasive species control methods (i.e., targeting symbiosis with endophytic fungi, silencing genes that code for aggressive plant traits) that will promote the restoration and management of critical fish and wildlife habitats within the Great Lakes basin and across the nation.  When considered in an IPM context, it was focusing on understanding the physical and biological factors affecting the number and distribution of Phragmites populations.  It also was focused on identifying how Phragmites and other invasive plant species were interacting with their environments to gain a competitive advantage over native plants and exploring what chemical and biological processes may be targets for control.  Innovative strategies have shown encouraging progress.  Endophytic fungi were isolated in Phragmites, a new scientific discovery that now gives us a target for disrupting symbiotic relationships within the plants.  In addition, preliminary field trials suggest that Phragmites appears to have sensitivity to fungicide.  Similarly, our gene silencing work resulted in multiple sets of degenerative primers that were designed for genes associated with Phragmites photosynthesis, root development and reproduction.  Several Phragmites genes and delivery vectors are being tested in the Wayne State laboratory in preparation of field experiments into FY 2013.  Most significantly, we have successfully silenced a photosynthesis gene (i.e., created an albino leaf) in maize as we transition the technology to Phragmites. In to FY 2013 (i.e., Phase 2), we will use the early results of this project to emphasize how this work, for a relativel	Innovative Phragmites Control Strategy	-109.925	30.43	TRUE	-112.7	27.925	-106.8	32.622
43	Kurt Kowalski	Data	Forecast 	Lake	Lake:Lake Erie	Invasive Species	Two species of invasive Asian carps (bighead carp Hypophthalmichthys nobilis and silver carp H. molitrix) have been documented to be potentially migrating into Lake Michigan from the Illinois River system. Sampling funded by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and completed by Notre Dame University using an eDNA method has indicated the presence of the Asian Carp upstream of the electric fish barrier on the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal (CSSC). The electric fish barrier was erected on the CSSC upstream of the confluence with the Des Plaines River to prevent invasive species from moving between the Mississippi River Basin and the Lake Michigan Basin. The CSSC is hydraulically connected to the Grand Calumet River/Indiana Harbor Canal and the Little Calumet River through the Cal-Sag Channel providing another potential pathway to Lake Michigan if the barrier is breeched. These and other components of the Chicago River are collectively known as the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS). If Asian Carp move through the CAWS and become established in Lake Michigan, several tributary rivers may provide suitable spawning habitat. Although the carp primarily live in slow moving water, they are thought to require streams with certain length, velocity, and turbulence to spawn (Kolar and others, 2007). Kolar and others (2007) contains a map of 22 rivers flowing into Lakes Erie, Huron, Michigan, and Superior that may meet the criteria for spawning (see map). However, after discussion with the Wisconsin Water Science Center (Kevin Richards, personal communication), the Sheboygan and Manitowok Rivers were eliminated. Both have dams that shorten the river length available for fish passage to below what is thought to be conducive to spawning. Instead, the Milwaukee River was suggested because it has a sufficient reach length, due to a recent dam removal and a large quantity of data available. This investigation would focus on determining the spawning suitability of the two rivers closest to the outlet of the CAWS into Lake Michigan—the Saint Joseph River in Michigan and the Milwaukee River in Wisconsin. Asian carps spawn in rivers, in locations of high water turbulence. The eggs and young larvae drift in the current. They are slightly heavier than water but remain in the drift because of the turbulence of flowing water. If the eggs and preswimming larvae sink to the bottom and remain there, they are generally not thought to survive. Thus a river with adequate current and reach length to keep the eggs and larvae adrift through this period is considered a requirement for reproduction of Asian carps and survival of their eggs and larvae. One hundred kilometers is often given as a rough estimate of the minimum river length required (Krykhtin and Gorbach 1981), but the actual minimum length of river would vary among rivers, depending upon variables such as water temperature (which controls developmental rate of the eggs and larvae), current velocity, and the longitudinal dispersal of the eggs and larvae in the drift. Also, a minimum current velocity below which eggs and larvae would settle to the bottom most likely must be maintained throughout the drift. Reported velocities of rivers where carp successfully reproduce ranged from 0.6 to 2.3 m/s (Chang 1966; Verigin et al. 1978), but unpublished data indicate that lower minimum velocities may be possible (Dr. István Tátrai, Senior Sentist, Balaton Limnological Research Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, personal communication). It is unknown if the minimum velocity varies with developmental stage or between eggs and larvae. More research is needed to quantify the hydraulic conditions and the temperature requirements for Asian Carp development. Once these requirements are better quantified, a model can be developed to refine the screening processes for rivers for spawning and egg and larvae development suitability to focus monitoring and spawning control strategies."

By quantifying the sources of phosphorus; and using models to simulate the likely response of each of these Lakes to changes in phosphorus loading, various lake-management actions will be assessed to improve water quality, and provide information to construct a Total Maximum Daily Load for the Winnebago Pool Lakes.  A detailed water budget will be developed for the Pool Lakes by measuring all major inflow and outflow sources and estimating the magnitude of minor sources. A detailed phosphorus budget will be obtained by quantifying the phosphorus loading associated with each water inflow and outflow source. Loading at each stream monitoring site will be estimated using a rating curve method or GCLAS with streamflow monitored by the USGS (three sites are being monitored by the USGS as part of this study) and water quality data collected by the Wisconsin DNR. Loading from ungaged areas will be obtained from the SWAT modeling being performed in the basin as part of separate studies. The current water quality (trophic state) of each of the four lakes in the Winnebago Pool will be obtained from the Wisconsin DNR and evaluated relative to longer-term trends.  These data will be used to verify/calibrate selected models in BATHTUB. BATHTUB will then be used to simulate the likely response of each of the Pool Lakes to phosphorus loading changes associated with various lake-management actions that might be implemented and specific climate scenarios. Output from the lake to the Lower Fox River will be estimated from data collected by the Wisconsin DNR at Neenah and Menasha and using output from the BATHTUB model.

The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) was established to accelerate ecosystem restoration in the Great Lakes by confronting the most serious threats to the region, such as nonpoint source pollution, toxic sediments, and invasive species. Three Priority Watersheds have been targeted by the Regional Working Group’s Phosphorus Reduction Work Group (Fox/Green Bay, Saginaw, and Maumee) and are characterized by having a high density of agricultural land use and have ecosystem impairments that have been clearly identified. Within the Fox River Priority Watershed, monitoring is being conducted at the sub-watershed and edge-of-field scale. The edge-of-field stations are targeted to those areas within each watershed that will be directly affected by the conservation efforts. These sites will allow for a rapid assessment of conservation implementation as the water quality from those locations are immediately affected by land-use and management changes and represent the major pathways for non-point pollution to enter the stream.  Relationships between the smaller to sub-watershed scale will help develop an understanding on how conservation efforts may impact the watershed as a whole. This effort will accelerate quantification of current and ongoing efforts in the Lower Fox GLRI Priority subwatershed with a focus on the smallest scale of implementation (field scale) and is responsive to RWG questions/requests regarding the need to quantify impacts of priority GLRI activities through relevant science and monitoring. USGS will undertake and coordinate a multi-agency effort to predict losses of phosphorus, nitrogen, and sediment from individual fields using established water quality monitoring networks and simulation tools. Results may be scaled-up to examine broader scale effects and reasonable/achievable reductions that can be expected from targeted activities.

Thirty of the 59 major downstream flow gages are continuously operating for water-quality samplings at these sites.  The work builds on current USGS monitoring efforts and those of partners in the Great Lakes. The results of this effort will provide information of current loads and measure the effectiveness of restoration efforts in selected tributaries. The USGS nutrient tributary monitoring network follows the National Monitoring Network for Coastal Waters design. Scientists collect real-time, near-real-time, and synoptic flow and water-quality data (sediment and nutrients) from tributaries to the Great Lakes. The data provide baseline information to assess effectiveness of restoration and land management activities. Site-specific regression equations are being developed to relate selected laboratory-analyzed analyte concentrations in the discrete samples to measurements recorded by the water-quality monitors. This will enable near-continuous estimates of analytes and allow a reduction in laboratory samples, reducing costs while preserving temporal density of data. This work supports Great Lakes Lakewide Area Management Plans and Remedial Action Plans. A methodology for providing uncertainty estimates on regression models of field measurements of water quality vs. hourly surrogate estimates of those water-quality parameters has been developed using Kalman filtering procedures.  These filters will be used to estimate magnitudes and uncertainties of suspended-sediment concentrations and flows, which will help compute the expected magnitudes and uncertainties of loads of selected water-quality constituents at each site in the future.

Seismic data collection is planned to complete an assessment of the distribution of seismic energy when the water gun(s) is used within the CSSC, and other parts of the CAWS near O’Brien Lock and Dam, and compare it to energy created by barge traffic and industry background seismic sources. The water gun(s) have been proposed to be used in the maintenance cycle on the electric barrier to help remove fish from the area between Electric Barriers 2A and 2B. In September 2010, the water gun was deployed in old sand and gravel pits connected to the Illinois River, and it was monitored with surface geophysical instrumentation for seismic signals generated on land.  The monitoring showed ground responses to the water guns, with the magnitudes approximate in signal strength to a car driving on the dirt road nearby or people walking nearing the geophones.  However, the conditions at this location with unconsolidated sands and gravels would be considerably different than the dominantly bedrock conditions present in the CSSC, and more of the seismic energy from the water gun would be expected to transfer to the bedrock, as well as reflected back into the CSSC.  Also, concerns on sheet piles and other structures were not assessed. USGS will work with the USACE and IL DNR to develop an agreed upon Scope of Work to complete work in 2012."

One potential method is to use multiple alleles or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The U.S. Geological Survey Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center (UMESC) will assist with collecting, processing and analyzing DNA samples from multiple populations of AC. This project is a continuation of ACRCC Framework 2.6.5 and complements ACRCC Framework 2.6.3. UMESC will assist in the collection of tissues for DNA analysis from AC from various populations and help extract DNA from those tissues and prepare it for sequencing. Once the DNA is sequenced, UMESC will work with researchers from the Army Corps of Engineers to compare nucleotide sequences among the populations.

59	Edward Roseman	Data	Radiation	Channel	Channel:Niagara Channel	Invasive Species	Recent advances have created the potential to develop new bioactive compounds and new targeted oral delivery platforms to increase species-specific control of invasive species within priority aquatic systems such as the Great Lakes. Novel bioactive compounds, including natural products (e.g., algal, bacterial or fungal products) or pathogens, have the potential to enhance integrated pest management programs; accessing chemical libraries in industry may speed the identification of such compounds. Identifying differences in the physiological characteristics of specific target sites (e.g., gill, gastrointestinal tract) of Aquatic Invasive Species and native aquatic species will enhance the development of targeted oral delivery platforms that, through the use of novel incorporation technologies, have the capacity to deliver biocides to specific target sites in Aquatic Invasive Species. Developing such a targeted oral delivery platform may increase the selectivity and specificity of both current and potential new management chemicals, especially if combined with the identification, development and synthesis of attractant and/or repellant pheromones of AIS such as Asian carps. Understanding the risks associated with Asian carp invasion of the Great Lakes will enable managers to take informed management actions to respond to the potential invasion. Characterizing the flexibility of Asian carp to adjust their diet to available resources will enhance our ability to assess the risk of Asian carps establishing reproductive populations in the oligotrophic waters of the Great Lakes. Accurate descriptions of the dynamics between Asian carps and bluegreen algae will likewise enable managers to better assess the potential of Asian carps to enhance noxious algal blooms in the Great Lakes. This integrated project will focus on developing these approaches for application to control of Asian Carps and Dreissenid Mussels throughout the Great Lakes.

60	Doug Yeskis	Project	Ventilation	Channel	Channel:St. Clair/Detroit River System	Invasive Species	Technologies presently do not exist to specifically target Asian carp for control within aquatic ecosystems. Current applications of non-selective toxicants (e.g., Rotenone) harm native fish species and must be applied to broad expanses of aquatic habitat if they are to have effect. The lack of a species-specific method of attraction (e.g., pheromones) limits the ability to achieve maximal control while minimizing risk to native fishes. Developing attractants with high specificity for Asian carp is necessary to control or eradicate them without further harm to native species and habitat. Progress made in 2010 included the identification of over 240 different compounds to screen for pheromone properties. In September work began with the University of Minnesota to screen these compounds by fish response. Six hundred juvenile bighead carp were acquired for the testing phase. In 2011, completion of physiological olfactory screen is expected of over 100 chemicals from 18 classes of sex pheromone metabolite chemicals, and behavioral studies of about 40 of the most effective of these. Expanded screening will be conducted for the most promising of the attractants to determine consistency and persistence of response with follow up proof of concept pond mesocosm (water enclosure) tests to confirm responsiveness in the field. Problem: Technologies presently do not exist to specifically target Asian carp for control within aquatic ecosystems. Current applications of non-selective toxicants (e.g. rotenone) harm native fish species and must be applied to broad expanses of aquatic habitat if they are to have effect. The lack of a species-specific method of attraction (e.g. pheromone) limits managers’ ability to achieve maximal control while minimizing risk to native fishes. Developing attractants with high specificity for Asian carp are necessary to control or eradicate them without further harm to native species and habitat. Action: USGS will conduct research to better define the active pheromone components and the response of Asian carps to pheromone products. Conceptual models will be developed in which pheromones could be integrated into management programs to control or limit Asian carps. Methods will be developed to synthesize active pheromone components.	Expand Research on the Identification of Asian Carp Attraction/Repulsion Pheromones	-95.203	34.275	TRUE	-96.3	33.352	-94.32	35.066
61	Doug Yeskis	Publication	Procrastination	Lake	Lake:Lake Michigan	Invasive Species	Problem: Current toxicants used to control aquatic invasive species are non-selective and applied as immersion exposures – resulting in equal exposure of native and invasive species to the toxicant. Development of a targeted delivery system which reduces non-target species exposure to the toxicant could greatly enhance selectivity and reduce effects to non-target species. Development of such delivery methodologies will require full understanding of native and invasive species gill and gut enzyme activity and physiology since a targeted delivery system will likely use an oral or gill adhesion delivery route. Action: Research will be conducted to identify and characterize potential bioactive agent delivery sites within AIS including the gill, skin, and gastrointestinal tract (gastric or post-gastric). Research will focus on collection of data on the physiological characteristics of both AIS and native species (e.g., enzyme, protein, lipid, carbohydrate components, pH) to provide an understanding of factors that might affect delivery of a bioactive agent. While some basic research is available in this area, additional basic and applied research will lead to development of optimized delivery components to enhance selectivity and sensitivity. Research planned to characterize Asian carp gastrointestinal pH and digestive enzyme profiles will be expanded to include identification and characterization of native fish gastrointestinal tracts.

62	Jonathan Sleeman	Data	Hydration	Lake	Lake:Lake Erie	Invasive Species	Problem: Tributaries that would be suitable for bighead carp spawning need to be identified to focus management efforts for evaluating invasion success, as well as sites to launch control actions. Action: Although bighead carps are preferentially inhabitants of lakes and slow moving waters, they are thought to require a long river for spawning and recruitment. An often-cited value in the literature is a minimum length of 100 km. Kolar et al. (2007) identifies 22 rivers on the USA boundaries of the Great Lakes that have a minimum undammed river length of 100 km, and an Asian carp risk assessment performed by the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans includes an inventory of the Canadian Rivers with a minimum length of 50 km. However, the estimates of river length required are based on locations where populations of bighead carps are known to be found, and thus do not describe a true minimum. Recent research at CERC has determined the developmental stage at which bighead carp larvae are capable of swimming and migrating laterally from flowing water into nursery habitats. This knowledge can be used in a model of river velocity and temperature to describe an actual river length required. This more accurate minimum river length, taken together with the temperature and velocity regimes of individual rivers, can be used to more accurately determine which rivers are suitable for spawning and recruitment of bighead carps.

63	Doug Yeskis	Project	Airation	Lake	Lake:Lake Huron	Invasive Species	Asian carp have been observed to diversify their diets beyond preferred pelagic plankton sources and feed on organic matter (“detritus”) during certain conditions and on the basis of availability of food resources. Silver carp are also thought to derive substantial nutrition from bacteria, both consumed and cultured in the gut. However, it is not known whether these food sources are adequate for growth and survival of Asian carp. It is unknown if Asian carp can sustain themselves in the Great Lakes. USGS hired the necessary personnel and purchased the equipment necessary to test the existing model that assumes Asian carp can’t survive in Lake Michigan. Personnel began testing of the model on bighead carp. In addition, personnel looked at the behavior of Asian carp to seek out and eat alternative food. Cladophora, one of these alternative food sources, is being grown in culture for testing. Data collection began for this project in July 2010.  In FY 2011, the project will be expanded to test the model on silver carp and outdoor mesocosm work with both species. Data collection which began in July 2010 will continue. The current model being tested will be altered as needed throughout the testing phase.

64	Jonathan Sleeman	Publication	Botulism	Lake	Lake:Lake Superior	Nearshore Health and Pollution	A Department of Interior team, including U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and National Park Service (NPS), is working to determine why botulism outbreaks, which have killed large numbers of fish and fish-eating birds, are occurring in the Great Lakes.  This project will determine: 1) a quick assay test for the presence of the toxin , 2) how birds are exposed to the toxins, and 3) what factors combined trigger an outbreak.  This information will be used to formulate management strategies. Botulism intoxication is caused by ingestion of neurotoxins produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum.  Periodic outbreaks of type E botulism have resulted in die-offs of fish and fish-eating birds in the Great Lakes since at least the 1960s, but outbreaks have become more common and widespread since 1999.  Botulism has been responsible for over 100,000 bird deaths on the Great Lakes since 1999, and extensive bird mortality in northern Lake Michigan near Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore (SLBE; over 4150 birds in 2007) received widespread press attention and caused great public concern.  The actual sites of toxin exposure for birds remain unknown. Spores of C. botulinum are naturally widely distributed in the environment, but toxin production occurs only when suitable environmental conditions allow spore germination and cell growth, and this may be related to local soil and water conditions.  The physical and ecological factors that are associated with toxin production, waterbird exposure, and botulism outbreaks are poorly understood in the Great Lakes, as in other environments.  Invasive species, particularly dreissenid mussels Dreissena spp. and round gobies Neogobius melanostomus, have been implicated in the recent increased occurrence of botulism mortality in Great Lakes fish and birds, but this has not been proven.  Dreissenid mussels may enhance nearshore algal growth, and decomposing algae may help create the anoxic conditions required for C. botulinum germination. We hypothesize that recent increases in the incidence of type E avian botulism outbreaks in the Great Lakes may be associated with the presence of large amounts of decomposing sloughed Cladophora.  We propose to determine the presence or absence of C. botulinum and type E botulinum toxin in sediments.  In FY 2013, targeted sampling sites will be chosen in northern Lake Michigan near SLBE to represent sites that support varying amounts of sloughed Cladophora at a range of depths throughout the season.  We further propose to use population surveys to assess waterbird distribution, with emphasis on species historically impacted by type E botulism (e.g., Common Loon Gavia immer), to examine the spatial relationships between bird distribution and carcass detection of confirmed botulism mortalities, and to analyze the relation between botulism in birds and environmental conditions at locations where toxin exposure is likely to occur.

66	David Bunnell	Data	Water 	Lake	Lake:Lake Erie	Habitat and Wildlife	U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) will conduct seasonal sampling of sport fish and their food sources to complement the seasonal sampling of lower level food sources that is routinely conducted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This data will provide a more holistic understanding of how aquatic invasive species could be altering food sources for sport fishes in the Great Lakes.  The data will be used by the Great Lakes Fishery Commission and their member states to determine fishing limits and hatchery releases. Prey fish population declines and prey fish community changes have occurred in each of the Great Lakes over the past decade with negative implications for lake trout restoration and the success of important recreational and commercial fisheries.  Factors underlying these changes are often not well understood within or among the lakes as the lakes differ in prey species, invasive species, and productivity.  During EPA’s year of intensive sampling, which annually rotates among the lakes, USGS has been sampling each lake’s food web, from nutrients to top predatory fish, along a nearshore to offshore gradient to determine if changes in lower trophic levels are driving declines in prey fish biomass that support important fisheries. By deploying similar sampling designs across all of the Great Lakes, USGS can make food web comparisons across lakes where differences in productivity, the degree of invasiveness, and the history of management can provide contrasts that will hopefully elucidate whether prey fish declines are being driven by a common factor or if independent factors are operating in each lake.  FY 2013 funding will support Lake Erie CSMI work that will occur in 2014. Lake Michigan (2010): Two transects were sampled monthly in northern Lake Michigan at three depths.  We are evaluating whether fish predation can regulate spiny water flea population and evaluating whether secondary production declines from nearshore to offshore.  A Lake Michigan decision support tool has also been developed that will allow fishery managers to explore different stocking scenarios to support restoration of native lake trout. Lake Superior (2011): Seasonal collections were made along three transects at 20, 50, and 110 m.  Summer samples were collected at 56 random locations throughout the lake at depths from 7 to 300 m.  Lake Superior has the most intact native fauna among the Great Lakes, so these data provide a baseline of energy transfer information for comparison to the other lakes.  Lake Huron (2012): Similar to Lake Michigan, two transects were sampled monthly in northern and central Lake Huron.  Following up on knowledge gained from the 2007 CSMI year, we are evaluating spatiotemporal overlap of planktivores (such as spiny water flea) and zooplankton prey.  We are evaluating whether secondary production declines from nearshore to offshore- hypothesizing less of a “nearshore” shunt than in Lake Michigan because of lower densities of quagga mussels in Lake Huron relative to Lake Michigan. Lake Ontario (2013): USGS is currently working with partners to execute similar nearshore to offshore depth stratified sampling as accomplished in the upper lakes, at three sites along the south shore.  USGS is working with partners (NYSDEC and OMNR) to secure additional transects in US waters and/or additional transects along the north shore in Canadian waters.  Additional funding supplied by EPA region 2 will be used to study predator diets from angler-caught salmonids and from smallmouth bass and yellow perch captured with gill nets nearshore. Lake Erie (2014): Similar to Lake Ontario, advance funding enables USGS to build cross agency collaborations for improving sampling efficiency and leveraging increased partner participation and funding for FY 2014 efforts.

67	James Johnson	Publication	Streamflow	Lake	Lake:Lake Huron	Habitat and Wildlife	U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is restoring native Atlantic salmon in Lake Ontario by raising and releasing fish and conducting assessments to evaluate restoration success.  Working closely with New York State, Iroquois Native Americans, and Ontario governments, USGS scientists are ensuring that the scientifically-based techniques and strategies used will provide the highest probability of success while avoiding potential fish diseases.  This project will phase in restoration of white fish, herring and lake sturgeon in Lake Ontario using similar methods. Three native species (Atlantic salmon, bloater, lake herring), comprising both predator and prey species, are currently being reared and released in Lake Ontario under this template in an attempt to restore ecosystem stability over multiple trophic levels.  Template 72 is attempting to restore a resilient native Great Lake fish community to help curb the expansion of invasive species.  Information generated from this study should have transferability throughout all of the Great Lakes. Using principles of applied science, USGS scientists are identifying techniques and strategies that will provide the highest probability of success for native species restoration in Lake Ontario for Atlantic salmon, deepwater coregonids (bloater) and shallow water coregonids (lake herring). USGS is uniquely positioned to carry out the full array of restoration strategies, including fish propagation and post stocking evaluation for Atlantic salmon. Because of the complexities associated with the extirpation or decline of native fish species in the Great Lakes there is no single remedy suitable for the restoration of all species.  Recent increases in the abundance of coregonids in the upper Great Lakes are coincident with dramatic declines in alewife populations.  Unfortunately, although alewife populations in Lake Ontario are declining, there are no deepwater coregonids remaining in the lake to enable natural recovery.  Consequently, the restoration of coregonids, as well as extirpated Atlantic salmon, must at least initially rely on hatchery-reared fish.

68	Kurt Kowalski	Project	Simulation	Lake	Lake:Lake Superior	Habitat and Wildlife	U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists are focusing on restoring natural water flow and ecological processes between coastal wetlands in the Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge (Ohio) and adjacent to Lake Erie to improve fish and wildlife habitat. This pilot project will develop  approaches that will restore coastal wetland function and increase ecosystem resilience to be used as a model throughout the Great Lakes basin. USGS will focus on restoring natural hydrologic processes in diked coastal wetlands adjacent to Great Lakes waters to improve wetland functions like phosphorus retention and restoration of habitats for fish and wildlife.  Sustainable approaches are being developed in the Maumee River Area of Concern (AOC) to restore the hydrology and other processes that drive coastal wetland functions and increase ecosystem resiliency.  Results will be evaluated within an adaptive management framework and integrated with similar sites in the Saginaw River/Bay AOC and throughout the Great Lakes basin. Since the connection to the wetland was restored, the abundance and diversity of fish using the wetland habitats has exploded.  Northern pike and other recreationally and commercially valued species are again using the 40 ha wetland for reproduction and feeding.  Bird usage by waterfowl and several listed species is extensive.  Preliminary water-quality data indicate that the water exiting the wetland back into the Maumee River AOC had significantly less phosphorus and other nutrients than the incoming water, which has very positive implications for the water quality BUI for the Maumee River AOC.  Additional samples taken through FY 2013 will characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of fish use, nutrient retention, and other important wetland processes.  Coordinated efforts with the coastal wetland monitoring program, data collection efforts identified in Remedial Action Plans, NOAA-funded habitat restoration projects, and The Nature Conservancy to help guide regional restoration strategies and maximize basin-wide impact of locally-important projects.

69	Russ Strach	Data	Soils	Lake	Lake:Lake Ontario	Accountability and Monitoring	Fish habitat will be constructed in the St. Clair River at scientifically determined sites to help remove the BUI on fish habitat degredation. Loss of fish and wildlife habitat is Beneficial Use Impairment 14 in the St. Clair and Detroit River Areas of Concern. Since 2003, research monitoring and fish spawning habitat construction by the US Geological Survey, in collaboration with the Michigan Sea Grant and 15 other partners, has remediated loss of fish and wildlife habitat in the Detroit River, at Belle Isle and at Fighting Island.  A third fish habitat remediation project by USGS and Michigan Sea Grant, funded by the NOAA Great Lakes Habitat Restoration Program, is in progress now for construction of 1.25 acres of fish spawning habitat in the Middle Channel of the St. Clair River in March 2012, at a cost of $500,000. These three fish spawning habitat remediation projects have increased spawning success of more than 12 native fish species in the Detroit River, including the State- and Provincially-threatened lake sturgeon, and the commercially-valuable lake whitefish, and walleye that support fisheries in Lake Erie, worth over $2 Billion per year. The purpose and objectives of this research are compatible with the Strategic Vision for the U.S. Geological Survey in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Region (USGS 2000) and the National Fish Habitat Action Plan (www.fishhabitat.org). In 2011, with $100,000 of funding from the USEPA, the USGS modeled where water depth and water flow velocity are suitable for spawning by desirable native fish species, such as lake sturgeon, lake whitefish, and walleye, in the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers (see Bennion and Manny 2011a). This research revealed 9 sites in the St. Clair River and 9 sites in the Detroit River where water depth and flow are theoretically suitable for spawning by these three and other native fish species in these two rivers. Based on selected environmental criteria, their model assumed that these are the most suitable sites for successful spawning by native fish in the St. Clair River. In 2012 and 2013, with FY 2012 funding from the GLRI, the USGS Great Lakes Science Center proposes to conduct comprehensive physical and biological assessments of the substrates at the 9 potential St. Clair River spawning sites predicted by the geospatial model, compare and contrast spawning habitat quality at the 9 sites, and select two to three sites in Michigan waters where all requirements for spawning by native fishes are met, except for the presence of adequate amounts of rock rubble (> 30 cm of rubble thickness).  At those two to three sites, with about 60 percent of the requested funds, we will construct two to three fish spawning habitat projects, 1.0-1.5 acres in size, in the St. Clair River to further remediate past losses of fish spawning habitat in the St. Clair River AOC. The remaining FY2012 GLRI funds will be used for pre-construction site assessment and selection for spawning habitat construction and post-construction monitoring of fish egg deposition, larval fish production and geospatial modeling of fish spawning and nursery habitat connectivity at and downstream of the selected sites for habitat construction in the St. Clair AOC, and public outreach by Michigan Sea Grant to share the results of this remediation work with the Great Lakes community. Our pre-construction 2012 assessments will result in the name, location and size of each project and how many can be accomplished by the end of FY 2013. Our scientific assessments will measure the increase in fish production at the sites, as a result of this fish spawning habitat construction project. Concurrently, geospatial modeling will be conducted by D. Bennion and B. Manny to assess connectivity of St. Clair River fish spawning habitat site to fish nursery habitat in the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers, the St. Clair Delta, and Lake St. Clair.

71	Cyndi Rachol	Project	fish	Watershed	Watershed:Lake Michigan Basin	Nearshore Health and Pollution	Monitoring stations are located in the Swartz Creek area at the edge of a field where conservation practices will be implemented.  The proximity of the monitoring to the field will allow for more rapid understanding of the effects of agricultural conservation practices on water quality. The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) was established to accelerate ecosystem restoration in the Great Lakes by confronting the most serious threats to the region, such as nonpoint source pollution, toxic sediments, and invasive species. Three Priority Watersheds have been targeted by the Regional Working Group’s Phosphorus Reduction Work Group (Fox/Green Bay, Saginaw, and Maumee) and are characterized by having a high density of agricultural land use and have ecosystem impairments that have been clearly identified. Within the Saginaw River Priority Watersheds, monitoring will be conducted at the sub-watershed, edge-of-field, and subsurface-tile scale. The edge-of-field and subsurface-tile monitoring stations will be targeted to those areas within each watershed that will be directly affected by the conservation efforts. These sites will allow for a rapid assessment of conservation implementation as the water quality from those locations are immediately affected by land-use and management changes and represent the major pathways for non-point pollution to enter the stream.  Relationships between the smaller to sub-watershed scale will help develop an understanding on how conservation efforts may impact the watershed as a whole. This effort will accelerate quantification of current and ongoing efforts in the Flint GLRI Priority subwatershed with a focus on the smallest scale of implementation (field scale) and is responsive to RWG questions/requests regarding the need to quantify impacts of priority GLRI activities through relevant science and monitoring. USGS will undertake and coordinate a multi-agency effort to predict losses of phosphorus, nitrogen, and sediment from individual fields using established water quality monitoring networks and simulation tools. Results may be scaled-up to examine broader scale effects and reasonable/achievable reductions that can be expected from targeted activities. Coordination among scientists, water quality specialists, and modelers in NRCS, USGS, EPA, and partnering universities is expected. Linkages between this work and ongoing Great Lakes efforts to establish target loads for subwatersheds (e.g., Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement) will be explored.

72	Ed Bugliosi	Data	conservation	Watershed	Watershed:Lake Erie Basin	Nearshore Health and Pollution	The Great Lakes ecosystem has undergone major changes over the last two decades related to the invasion of Dreissenid mussels, increased water clarity, increased benthic algae and associated water quality problems.   For reasons not yet entirely understood, and that have bi-national significance, water column total phosphorus has not significantly increased over the last decade but the relative percent of the more biologically available dissolved phosphorus has increased.  The filtering action of Dreissenid mussels has been shown to increase concentrations of dissolved phosphorus in the water column immediately above mussel beds and this had been hypothesized as one explanation for the increase of benthic algae.   However, the Lake Ontario 2008 CSMI monitoring year’s assessment of nearshore water eutrophication problems concluded that localized eutrophication problems could not be explained by the presence of mussel beds alone.  Tributary nutrient inputs always appeared to be a common factor related to localized nearshore problems.  This work will expand the nearshore work begun in 2008, as part of a binational assessment coordinated by the Lake Ontario Lakewide Management Plan, to develop better understand the connection between tributary nutrient inputs and Lake Ontario nearshore water quality and nutrient fate and transport with the aim of identifying potential management actions.  This nearshore work will complement offshore work to be coordinated by US and Canadian Lake Ontario Lakewide Management Plan partners through the use of the research vessels Lake Guardian and Limnos. The maintenance of flow gaging systems and regular monitoring programs are essential to understand nutrient loadings and impacts.   This work will allow the maintenance of gaging stations and the collection of nutrient samples from six major, and several selected minor New York Lake Ontario tributaries through the 2014 field year.  Included will be the GLRI priority watershed, the Genesee River,  and Oak Orchard Creek, both identified as large nutrient loading basins to the southern shore of Lake Ontario.  In addition to seven regularly scheduled sampling events for each tributary, the sampling plan will be designed to capture spring, growing season and extreme flow events with a focus on understanding particulate and dissolved nutrient concentrations and loadings.  This work will be in addition to the work being conducted for template 76 at the Genesee River. This information will be of tremendous value in supporting the development of nutrient loading estimates and for the development of nutrient fate and transport models coincident with the new bi-national Great Lakes Water Quality agreement protocol. Studies of water quality and the lower foodweb at selected nearshore zones impacted by tributary inputs will be designed to better understand the fate and transport of nutrients in the water column and aquatic foodweb and the connection with the health of nearshore aquatic communities and local beaches along the Lake Ontario shoreline.   Timing of nearshore sampling events will be coordinated with tributary monitoring.    Both tributary and nearshore monitoring and research activities will place an emphasis on developing a better understanding of dissolved and total phosphorus ratios  and whether different ratios drive varying biological responses. All of this work will be coordinated with a range of US and Canadian Lake Ontario nutrient related work being conducted in 2013 in order to develop a basin-wide assessment of nutrient loadings, fate and transport and the identification of potential management strategies and research in support of the Lake Ontario Lakewide Management Plan (LaMP).   A review of currently on-going, and soon-to-be completed, nutrient-related studies, including fate and transport and the response of biological systems, will be included as part of initial planning workshops and factored into the final nearshore project design.

First, the models will provide a heuristic understanding of energy flow within each of the Great Lakes, and help managers understand whether predator/prey interactions are balanced.  Second, the data will contribute to models that will allow managers to explore how possible future perturbations or management actions could influence key species at multiple trophic levels.  We will work closely with state management agencies and stakeholder groups to ensure that ecosystem models that emerge from this work explore relevant future management scenarios.     USGS will conduct seasonal sampling of benthic invertebrates, zooplankton, prey fish, sport fish, and their diets to complement the seasonal lower trophic level sampling by EPA. This data will provide a more holistic understanding of how invasive-driven, food-web changes could be altering energy available to sport fishes in the Great Lakes and used to build ecosystem models and make cross-lake comparisons of food web changes.

78	Howard Reeves	Data	Fish	Channel	Channel:St. Lawrence Channel	Accountability and Monitoring	U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) will develop and provide  forecasting tools for managers to determine how water withdrawals or other hydrologic or land use changes in watersheds may affect Great Lakes ecosystems. This information will help guide restoration efforts to achieve maximum effectiveness and success. Project provides unified information across the Great Lakes Basin for ecosystem restoration, assessment, and management by incorporating models that relate changes in landscape and hydrologic variables and stresses to changes in ecosystem function.  The project relies upon regionally consistent hydrologic, biologic, and geospatial data to generate regionally consistent estimates, models, and analysis. USGS is the Circular A-16 theme lead for hydrographic spatial data.  As such USGS has responsibility to coordinate with other federal agencies, states, and other entities the development and stewardship of the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD).  USGS also has developed in partnership with EPA the NHDPlus, it has a memorandum of understanding with The Nature Conservancy to study environmental flows and impacts of hydrologic alterations on ecology.  USGS has been a lead agency in the development of techniques and methods to estimate streamflow characteristics in gaged and ungaged watersheds and in developing, applying, and coordinating research in ecology and hydroecology. Products from this research will include a consistent hydrologic dataset of the US Great Lakes Basin built on the 1:100,000 NHDplus and attributed with landscape and aquatic ecologic variables.  Empirical models developed for fish distribution, temperature, and streamflow will be developed. A hierarchical lotic habitat classification framework and fish-based lotic habitat classification will be built on the hydrologic dataset. Field sampling and experimental campaigns aimed at testing and improving the lotic classification schemes will be designed.  The sampling design will be implemented by coordinating with existing field-based sampling teams and efforts through Federal and State agencies and Universities.

81	Ed Bugliosi	Project	Ventilation	Channel	Channel:St. Clair/Detroit River System	Accountability and Monitoring	Since 2010, connecting channels have been included in each of the Great Lakes’ Lake Management Plans (LaMPs). Lake Ontario now includes both the Niagara River and the St. Lawrence River.  The Niagara River is well characterized by a number of long-term programs, but because of the lack of tributary water-quality data, the St. Lawrence River and its tributaries constitute a data gap in the information needed for the Lake Ontario to fulfill its goals.  Critical information needs include basic water-quality parameters, total suspended solids, nutrients and flow data.  These data are needed to aid in the identification of sources of nutrient and sediment loading to the St. Lawrence.  The monitoring network will consist of seven sites on four rivers (the St. Lawrence and three tributaries: Grass River, Raquette River, and St Regis River), and will include monitoring two locations on the three tributary rivers.  In addition, the St. Lawrence River will also be sampled.  Four samples will be collected during the first year of monitoring, starting in FY-13.  These samples will be scheduled at equal temporal intervals based on beginning date of the project.  Comparison of water-quality data from upstream to downstream sites will be useful in assessing the impact of sediment and nutrient sources between these sites. Field, laboratory, and flow parameters will be measured at each site during each visit. Field parameters will be collected at each site and will include pH, temperature, and specific conductance.   Samples will be collected and analyzed for Total Suspended Sediment and nutrients: [Ammonia as N, Nitrite, nitrite+nitrate, and Total Nitrogen] and [Orthophosphate (soluble reactive Phosphorous) and Total Phosphorous].  In cases where USGS flow data are not available, flow data will be collected at the site according to USGS protocols.  Analytical methods corresponding to those used in the GLRI Lake Ontario tributary sampling being performed by the USGS as part of template 153b in 2012 will be used.  One quality assurance sample will be collected per round of sampling; a total of two blanks and two replicates will be collected over the four sampling rounds.  Analytical data results will be reported to the EPA using spreadsheets and will also be available through the USGS National Water Quality Information (NWIS) site for the public.  These data will be provided within three months of the end of sample collection.

82	Mark Gaikowski	Publication	Procrastination	Lake	Lake:Lake Michigan	Invasive Species	U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is developing control techniques that can substantially improve the ability of natural resource managers to selectively target Dreissenid Mussels without harming other species.  Evaluation of potential toxicants will be incorporated into delivery systems that take advantage of the unique characteristics of dreissenid mussel feeding and digestion processes.  This effort is part of a larger integrated pest management strategy. The invasive dreissenid mussels (zebra and quagga mussels) are negatively affecting the Great Lakes and other waterbodies throughout the Great Lakes Basin.  Native species as well as recreational, municipal, industrial, and other water uses are adversely impacted by dreissenid mussels.  Methods of detecting and monitoring, as well as physical, biological, and chemical methods of control are critical needs if managers are to respond rapidly to new and existing infestations. Research under this template would provide the basis for developing an integrated pest management (IPM) strategy to prevent further range expansion and to control existing invasive dreissenid mussel populations – research that will support the prevention and control of current and future Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS). Research proposed for 2013 as part of this framework would examine several aspects of an IPM program to control dreissenid mussels. Understanding the invasion front and the extent of invasions is critical to any IPM program and research in this template would pursue developing eDNA markers to determine the presence/absence of dreissenid mussels and to differentiate their life stages. Development of these markers would enhance our ability to evaluate the efficacy of watercraft disinfection methods, detect new invasions and determine the effectiveness of treatments applied to infested water bodies. Control of dreissenid mussels in currently invaded waters requires a multi-pronged approach as no one method would likely provide adequate control in every situation. Proposed research will evaluate the potential of low frequency electromagnetic (LFEM) radiation to control dreissenid mussels. Laboratory investigations by Purdue University observed increased mortality of zebra mussels following LFEM radiation exposure. The project would evaluate the effectiveness of LFEM radiation to control dreissenid mussels and assess potential non-target effects on native mussels. In addition, we would pursue development of effective chemical control tools for dreissenid mussels in the areas of spawning inhibition and species-specific delivery of mussel toxicants. Dreissenid mussel spawning may be inhibited by chemical cues released by the bluegreen algae Microcystis aeruginosa. Because dreissenid mussels occur at high densities and use broadcast spawning, cues that inhibit spawning coordination likely induce a chain reaction of chemical and physiological events that propagate throughout the population. Studies within this template would seek to identify and evaluate those cues as potential methods to disrupt dreissenid spawning. Work within the template would also apply knowledge gained in the development of methods to incorporate biocides into a targeted delivery system to control the invasive bighead and silver carps, in order to identify and incorporate mussel toxicants into targeted delivery formulations specifically for the control of dreissenid mussels. Using the peer-reviewed literature, we will identify toxicants with demonstrated activity to dreissenid mussels and with the highest likelihood of successful registration by EPA. Selected toxicants will be incorporated into delivery systems that take advantage of the unique characteristics of dreissenid mussels feeding and digestion processes.

Managers can use this framework to match Area of Concern habitat restoration targets to previously identified stream and river mouth impacts on the lakes. Building on biological indicators of the condition of aquatic ecosystems developed by university and federal agency scientists in other U.S. regions, USGS will develop similar biological indicators appropriate for evaluating influences of tributaries on near shore and deep water systems within the Great Lakes. Research will focus on vertebrate and invertebrate species/communities and their ecological attributes in developing appropriate indicators. Outcome will be to enhance availability, awareness and application of biological indicators in management and restoration of the Great Lakes. Collectively across four sub-projects, we propose to take a comprehensive scientific approach that encompasses an integrated and holistic suite of essential stream/river ecosystem characteristics.  The approach will consider whole watershed dynamics, across a continuum from the terrestrial landscapes of the Great Lakes tributary watersheds to nearshore and deepwater lake habitats.

In 2013, on Lake Ontario USGS will sample the food web from a nearshore (20 m) to offshore (100 m) gradient where seasonal sampling of primary producers, benthic invertebrates, zooplankton, prey fish, sport fish, and their diets will occur.  We will work closely with state management agencies and stakeholder groups to ensure that ecosystem models that emerge from this work explore relevant future management scenarios.  Scientists will analyze the diets of the six species of trout and salmon currently occurring in Lake Ontario.  This predator diet analysis is the key trophic link that integrates lower trophic level productivity with top predator production and sport fishery success.  Bridging primary and secondary production to top predators will also inform native species restoration.

The work done by this project provides managers with forecasting tools for predicting the combined effects of climate and land use changes that will help them identify and prioritize the sites best suited  for restoration efforts.     USGS scientists will use remote-sensing data to establish a baseline understanding of current distributions of invasive wetland plants and then forecast potential invasion corridors.  Alterations to the Great Lakes shoreline or water-level patterns associated with global climate change could have significant impacts on the extent and composition of coastal habitat.  Low lake levels can expose fertile wetland bottomlands to invasive species such as common reed (Phragmites).

92	Cris Marsh	Data	sediment	Lake	Lake:Lake St. Clair	Invasive Species	U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) will identify through this project significant sources and impacts of historical and newly emerging toxics to the Great Lakes ecosystem through broad surveillance as well as laboratory and field research of tree swallows and other bird species.  USGS scientists will determine the amount of exposure to and the effects of historical and emerging contaminants in Great Lakes food chains. The data will inform regulators and provide guidance on removal of Beneficial Use Impairments at Area of Concern sites around the Great Lakes.  Work supported under this project is quantifying exposure to, and effects of, both historical and emerging contaminants on Great Lakes food chains using sentinel indicator species such as colonial waterbirds and tree swallows.  Results will contribute directly to assessments of Great Lakes ecosystem health and science-based decision making, provide data that will be directly used by States and EPA to assess whether specific BUIs can be removed and AOC’s subsequently delisted, provide a baseline for future trend analysis, and determine the effectiveness of recent remediation actions at AOCs and other known hotspots.  The tree swallow data provide for a biological matrix that is consistent across all AOCs and allows direct comparisons among AOCs and comparisons to non-AOC locations across not only the Great Lakes, but also the northern tier of states in the U.S. as well as Canada.  Because swallows can be enticed to nest at AOCs with the use of nest boxes, similar data will be available for all AOCs.  Because there are effects thresholds already established for tree swallows, or other avian species, it can be determined directly whether exposures to contaminants of various chemical classes are at or above levels of concern.  The collection of colonial waterbird data, where those species occur, in conjunction with the tree swallow data, will allow for modeling and assessment of possible contaminant effects throughout the aquatic ecosystem.  The limited feeding radius of swallows and close ties to sediment contamination allow for an assessment of the biological availability of sediment contaminants as well as quantification of changes in sediment contamination that will be directly usable by EPA in remedy effectiveness assessments.

94	Russ Strach	Project	indicators	Watershed	Watershed:Lake Erie Basin	Accountability and Monitoring	Builds on CSMI year of intensive sampling to sample lower foodweb invertebrates to allow better management of all tropic levels of Lake Ontario. The Lake Ontario food web is perhaps the most severely impacted in all of the Great Lakes and impacts driven by the introduction of non-indigenous species continue to drive large-scale changes today.  The invasive species driven food web in Lake Ontario is of stark contrast to the mostly native food web of Lake Superior and provides the endpoint of the continuum of impacts that occurs moving downstream through the other Great Lakes.  The contrasts and similarities between lakes will help inform the question of how replacement of native species with invasives alters energy pathways and impacts trophic efficiency.  Spatially and temporally rigorous sampling within lakes coupled with standardized methods and syntheses across lakes will allow us to use gradients in food web structure and productivity to explore how nutrient changes at the bottom of the food web impact fish production at the top; how species replacements alter production across trophic levels; and how biologically and environmentally mediated physical changes (e.g., light transmission, temperature change, etc.) alter the food web.  Ecosystem models resulting from this work allow managers to explore how future perturbations or management actions influence key trophic responses in Lake Ontario. Data Collection and analyses: This study follows EPA’s year of intensive sampling around the Great Lakes and complements and expands upon EPA and other partner entities work.

99	William Richardson	Publication	Foodweb	Channel	Channel:St. Mary's Channel	Accountability and Monitoring	U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists are working to identify and understand the role tributaries to the Great Lakes play in influencing the quality of nearshore and deepwater habitats and the dynamics associated with the mixing of river and lake waters. A scientific framework will be developed for restoration and management in these areas. Managers can use this framework to match Area of Concern habitat restoration targets to previously identified stream and river mouth impacts on the lakes.  The overall intent of this project is to provide, based on intensive and extensive sampling across representative Great Lakes rivermouths, improved guidance for restoration of Great Lakes rivermouth estuarine processes, habitats, and services, and for planning of ecologically sustainable development in these already highly-developed zones.  These complex ecological zones are little recognized nor well understood at present, by scientists or resource managers working in the Great Lakes.  Our first objective is to determine how rivermouth zone habitats are structured by the intersection of lake processes, riverine processes, and local coastal geomorphology.  This information will guide restoration in terms of identifying critical habitat needs, assuring alignment with fundamental rivermouth ecosystem processes, planning for effects of ongoing land use and climate changes, and identifying achievable endpoints or reference conditions for restoration actions.  Our second objective is to develop a set of food web ‘health indicators,’ that will help both the project team and natural resource managers interpret and assess rivermouth ecological condition, while accounting for natural variations in lake and river conditions.  These will provide powerful tools for management, as these estuaries are viewed as critical, productive nursery grounds for many Great Lakes fish populations, recognizing that this productivity is dependent on healthy food webs.  We are tackling three spatial scales in this project: 1) the entire set of U.S. rivermouths, to characterize extent and variability at this regional landscape scale based on synoptic GIS analyses; 2) a subset of 20-30 rivermouths distributed throughout the Great Lakes Basin, in which we conduct extensive field studies at the lake/basin ecosystem scale; and 3) selected, representative rivermouths (3-4) on Lake Michigan, in which we conduct intensive field studies at a local rivermouth scale; these findings will nest within broader-scale frameworks defined based on synoptic analyses of the entire suite of Great Lakes rivermouths. Within this conceptual framework, our research will be organized within five interconnected tasks: Task 1 - Synoptic characterization of all Great Lakes rivermouths.  This work will help local and regional managers understand the entire spectrum of rivermouth types, as well as the key driving variables at work for local restoration applications. Task 2 - Facilitate regional, collaborative discussions to build broad-based scientific understanding and management applications (the Great Lakes Rivermouth Collaboratory).  For restoration success at the ecosystem scale, it is critical that concepts, definitions, and approaches are broadly understood and accepted.  One product will be a peer-reviewed concept paper highlighting the status of science and management for rivermouth estuaries. Tasks 3 and 4 - Describe the characteristics and dynamics of these hydrologic mixing zones, and describe component habitats within rivermouths, informed by both physical metrics and biological use.  This understanding will serve to guide an array of restoration activities, including identifying critical habitat needs, assuring alignment with fundamental ecosystem processes, and planning for effects of land use and climate change.
