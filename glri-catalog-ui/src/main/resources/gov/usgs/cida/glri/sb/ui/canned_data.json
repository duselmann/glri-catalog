This project will determine: 1) a quick assay test for the presence of the toxin , 2) how birds are exposed to the toxins, and 3) what factors combined trigger an outbreak. This information will be used to formulate management strategies. Botulism intoxication is caused by ingestion of neurotoxins produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. Periodic outbreaks of type E botulism have resulted in die-offs of fish and fish-eating birds in the Great Lakes [...]",

            "summary": "Silver carp and bighead carp, two invasive Asian carp species, have become established in the Mississippi River watershed, and there is potential for these fish to invade the Great Lakes waters in the near future. Currently, prevention of the movement of Asian carp from the Mississippi watershed into the Great Lakes rests on a set of electric barriers installed in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal (CSSC). Additional barriers and/or supplements to the electric barrier would improve the efficacy of deterring Asian carp movement into the Great Lakes and elsewhere. Seismic technologies used in oil exploration create high pressure underwater sound energy waves that may deter the movement of Asian carp. These sound energy waves may be [...]",

As more was learned, additional research into the ecological impacts of bighead and silver carps on river ecology began, and continues today. Information gleaned from these studies has directly or indirectly benefited many Framework projects, from monitoring and surveillance to risk assessment and control. This is research that supports Framework efforts and is important for achieving Framework goals.",

Each measure is designed to prevent a distinct migration pathway of Asian carp toward the Great Lakes. These measures are: 1) The Bypass Barrier physically blocks known bypasses around the electric barriers that occur during periods of flooding from the Des Plaines River and the Illinois and Michigan (I&M) Canal, and halts possible fish movement through this area. The barriers placed in these locations are intended to stop juvenile and adult Asian carp. Additional and/or more permanent separation measures will be assessed in the Efficacy Study Report; 2) The Electric Barriers create a waterborne, pulsed, direct current, electric field in the Chicago [...]",

Nitrogen contamination in aquatic systems results from the decomposition of organic matter, as well as through agricultural inputs, sewage effluents and industrial activities. Nitrogen in its various forms is of ecological concern because of its ubiquitous distribution and toxicity to aquatic life. Nitrogen compounds pose a hazard to aquatic larval stages of amphibians, affecting survival and development, and inducing deformities and behavioral impairments. Declines in amphibian [...]",

Current applications of non-selective toxicants (e.g., Rotenone) harm native fish species and must be applied to broad expanses of aquatic habitat if they are to have effect. The lack of a species-specific method of attraction (e.g., pheromones) limits the ability to achieve maximal control while minimizing risk to native fishes. Developing attractants with high specificity for Asian carp is necessary to control or eradicate them without further harm to native species and habitat. Progress made in 2010 included the identification of over 240 different compounds to screen for pheromone properties. In September work began with [...]",

It was used as a monitoring tool for the ACRCC's MRRWG April 2011 MRRP. USACE, in partnership with USFWS, USGS, and USEPA, is developing a proposal to conduct an eDNA calibration study that will help provide context to a positive eDNA result. Variables investigated will include detection limits and decay rates; improvement in current field sampling techniques may result from investigation of optimal sampling methods.",

The filtering action of Dreissenid mussels has been shown to increase concentrations of dissolved phosphorus in the water column immediately above mussel beds and this had been hypothesized as one explanation for the increase of benthic algae.

Action: Although bighead carps are preferentially inhabitants of lakes and slow moving waters, they are thought to require a long river for spawning and recruitment. An often-cited value in the literature is a minimum length of 100 km. Kolar et al. (2007) identifies 22 rivers on the USA boundaries of the Great Lakes that have a minimum undammed river length of 100 km, and an Asian carp risk assessment performed by the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans includes an inventory of the Canadian Rivers with a minimum length of 50 km.

The Lake Ontario food web is perhaps the most severely impacted in all of the Great Lakes and impacts driven by the introduction of non-indigenous species continue to drive large-scale changes today. The invasive species driven food web in Lake Ontario is of stark contrast to the mostly native food web of Lake Superior and provides the endpoint of the continuum of impacts that occurs moving downstream through the other Great Lakes. The contrasts and similarities between lakes will help inform the question of how replacement of native species with invasives alters energy pathways and impacts [...]",

The invasive species driven food web in Lake Ontario is of stark contrast to the mostly native food web of Lake Superior and provides the endpoint of the continuum of impacts that occurs moving downstream through the other Great Lakes. The contrasts and similarities between lakes will help inform the question of how replacement of native species with invasives alters energy pathways and impacts [...]",

Development of such delivery methodologies will require full understanding of native and invasive species gill and gut enzyme activity and physiology, because a targeted delivery system will likely use an oral or gill adhesion delivery route.

            "summary": "Bluegreen algae (primarily Microcystis sp.) blooms resulting from the mussel invasion may provide an excellent food source for bighead carp, enhancing their invasion. Noxious bluegreen algal blooms, under some circumstances, can be enhanced by interaction with silver and bighead carp, and presence of these carp may enhance toxin production by noxious algae. USGS hired the necessary personnel and obtained permits for laboratory work. Work also began to culture the bluegreen algae and construction of the tank to house and feed Asian carp. In this second year of the project, the project will be expanded to outdoor water enclosures to accommodate larger fish than those used in the first year of the project. It is not anticipated that the [...]",

Seismic technology has the potential to eradicate invasive species through a range of age classes making it a viable candidate for integrated suppression efforts.
