        "body": "<h4>Description of Work<\/h4> The invasive form of \n<em>Phragmites australis<\/em> (common reed) is a well-established pest in many parts of the Great Lakes and the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts, including designated Areas of Concern. New innovative control options that sustainably target the competitive advantage often enjoyed by \n<em>Phragmites<\/em> and other invasive plants will contribute to a broad Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategy. This project targets the microorganisms that may help \n<em>Phragmites<\/em> spread and will employ a molecular genetic approach to silence the genes in \n<em>Phragmites<\/em> that give it a competitive edge over many native plants. This project helped build and will continue to be closely aligned with the Great Lakes Phragmites Collaborative that focuses on the people side of \n<em>Phragmites<\/em> IPM. Additional collaborative groups (e.g., Collaborative for Microbial Symbiosis and Phragmites Management) are being created through this work. Into FY2014 we will use the encouraging results of this project to emphasize how this work adds several new dimensions to the IPM strategy for \n<em>Phragmites<\/em> and other invasive plant species. The project will continue development of the Collaborative for Microbial Symbiosis and \n<em>Phragmites<\/em> Management, including completion of a science agenda for microbial symbiosis research. Fungal endophytes will be isolated and sequenced from several \n<em>Phragmites<\/em> stands and experiments to test endophyte-control and soil-restoration strategies will be initiated at field sites located in or near AOCs. Bacterial endophytes in \n<em>Phragmites<\/em> will be analyzed and their role in nitrogen fixation will be studied to explore contributions to the invasion process. Similarly, transcriptome data for \n<em>Phragmites<\/em> will be analyzed to identify target gene sequences for silencing. Experiments will be conducted to refine vectors for \n<em>Phragmites<\/em> and explore how other invasive plants (e.g., Oriental Bittersweet) could be managed by silencing select genes. Finally, the regulatory hurdles for implementation of new control strategies will be examined.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Relevance/Benefits<\/h4> The progress made on this project is encouraging, because this type of control could be customized for other invasive species. A goal of this research is to create a completely species- and trait-specific treatment framework that could be applied to a suite of invasive species and provide another tool for resource managers. That means that land managers may be able to treat rapidly expanding or well established stands of an invasive species without having detrimental effects on other, non-target plant or animal species. The effects of gene silencing are transient, in that they cannot spread within the plant or be transferred to offspring. There is a great deal of excitement about this research in the management community and the topic remains one of the most visited pages on the Great Lakes&nbsp;Phragmites&nbsp;Collaborative webpage ( \n<a href=\"http://greatlakesphragmites.net/\">http://greatlakesphragmites.net/<\/a>). These results and the overall direction of this project directly support the broader Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach being developed for&nbsp; \n<em>Phragmites<\/em>&nbsp;and many other invasive plants. There are many opportunities to work with the existing partners (e.g., SEMCOG, USFWS, TNC, GLC, DU) to build on this work, integrate with IPM efforts, and target our field trials in AOCs or other high priority sites.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Key Findings<\/h4> Preliminary results of a small study conducted in summer 2012 by Dr. Rusty Rodriguez (Symbiogenics), Dr. Regina Redman (University of Washington), and Dr. Kurt Kowalski (USGS ? Great Lakes Science Center) indicated that treatment of fungal endophytes (i.e., microbes found in all parts of plants) with the general use fungicide can decrease the number of new&nbsp; \n<em>Phragmites<\/em>&nbsp;stems growing compared to control plots. This initial study was conducted at a very small scale and did not allow for treatment of juvenile plants, but the results were promising. That study provided the underpinnings for a more comprehensive field study in 2013 that is designed to provide proof of concept that controlling endophytes can decrease the growth of&nbsp; \n<em>Phragmites<\/em>. This study will elucidate whether fungicide application affects the biomass production (above and below ground), stem density, and percent cover of&nbsp; \n<em>Phragmites<\/em>. It will also examine the effects of the treatments on native plant species diversity. This effort will produce the first comprehensive results that document how fungal associates can affect growth of the invasive&nbsp; \n<em>Phragmites<\/em>&nbsp;and provide a foundation for additional experiments on the path toward new control tools.\n<br /> \n<br /> The USGS has partnered with Dr. Edward Golenberg at Wayne State University to examine the potential use of gene silencing in \n<em>Phragmites<\/em> management. Gene silencing is a process whereby the genetic message necessary to code for particular proteins is blocked (silenced), thus blocking the development of specific traits. For instance, if researchers target and silence the genetic code essential for photosynthesis, a plant will not be able to harness the sun?s energy and growth will be stunted. The project team continues to make incremental progress toward the application of this technology as a form of \n<em>Phragmites<\/em> management. Researchers at Wayne State have identified a suitable transmission vector for monocot species and completed several ?proof of concept? studies silencing the photosynthetic ability of plants similar to \n<em>Phragmites<\/em>. These successes and analysis of the \n<em>Phragmites<\/em> will allow expanded lab testing of gene silencing techniques in \n<em>Phragmites<\/em>.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Products<\/h4> Braun, H. and K.

        "purpose": "Phragmites continues to spread throughout the Great Lakes and have negative impacts on coastal resources including critical fish and wildlife habitat and coastal viewscapes.  Current control strategies are time, labor, and resource intensive, so innovative methods to control the spread of Phragmites or minimize its invasive properties are needed.  This study will test new strategies to reduce the invasive properties of Phragmites and minimize its competitive advantage. Results of this project will be used to guide future proposals focused on potential implementation strategies for using successful techniques to control the invasive Phragmites haplotype M.  Results also will promote information sharing, technology transfer, management efficiency, and collaborations among those focused on Phragmites in the Great Lakes basin.",

        "body": "<h4>Description of Work<\/h4> This project is designed to (1) collect more frequent total suspended sediment (TSS) and total phosphorous (TP) data for the Genesee River Watershed, especially sub-watersheds at the 12-digit HUC (Hydrologic Unit code) scale, both within and outside of the AOC; and (2) to conduct a pilot study capable of evaluating the reduction in sediments and nutrients from the current and proposed GLRI non-point source reduction projects in the watershed aggregated at the 12-digit HUC. This project is envisioned as a two-year pilot for the Genesee River Watershed, with potentially wider applications in the Lake Ontario Basin and other Great Lake areas.\n<br /> &nbsp;",
        "purpose": "1. Collection of more frequent TSS and TP data for the Genesee River - Through this project, EPA Region 2 and USGS propose to increase the sampling spatial coverage of TSS, TP and SRP measurements, sampling at additional sites through the Genesee River Watershed. These data will increase our understanding of watershed and nearshore nutrient impairments and the sampling program will support the Integrated Nearshore Framework to be implemented under the revised GLWQA, Annex 2, Lakewide Management. The monitoring will inform the development of Lake Ontario Ecosystem Objectives and Substance Objectives such as nutrient objectives, and other potential threats to water quality, and help to identify and engage appropriate agencies in implementing prevention and protection strategies for the lake. 2. Pilot Study to Evaluate BMP Effectiveness and contributions - Monitoring receiving waters before and after best practices are implemented would provide valuable quantitative information on (1) the effectiveness of the practices on sediment and nutrient loading and (2) loading of sediment and nutrients from smaller watersheds within the larger Genesee River basin.  This information should then guide both the selection of most appropriate practices and also target sub-basins (smaller watersheds) that should be given priority for these practices to most effectively and efficiently utilize GLRI funds to meet the goal of sediment and nutrient reduction. In general, the outcomes and outputs will include, but may not be limited to: monitoring data to support or improve EQUIP projects, a larger data set of relevant parameters for the Genesee River and the watershed, lessons learned, and transferability of the project design and implementation to other areas of the Great Lakes.",

The virus sampling will provide a baseline for human and bovine viruses in tributaries and their potential impacts on human health.  Information on the occurrence and distribution of contaminants is needed to provide baseline information, measure progress towards restoration goals, and to assess new threats. Additional information is needed to provide an understanding of how contaminants reach the Great Lakes, and where they come from, so that the effects of future actions can be assessed and predicted",

Within the Maumee River Priority Watersheds, monitoring is being conducted at the sub-watershed, edge-of-field, and subsurface-tile scale. The edge-of-field and subsurface-tile monitoring stations are targeted to those areas within each watershed that will be directly affected by the conservation efforts. These sites will allow for a rapid assessment of conservation implementation as the water quality from those locations are immediately affected by land-use and management changes and represent the major pathways for non-point pollution to enter receiving streams. Relationships between the small to sub-watershed scale will help develop an understanding on how conservation efforts may impact the watershed as a whole. This effort will accelerate quantification of current and ongoing efforts in the Blanchard GLRI Priority subwatershed with a focus on the smallest scale of implementation (field scale) and is responsive to RWG questions/requests regarding the need to quantify impacts of priority GLRI activities through relevant science and monitoring. USGS will undertake and coordinate a multi-agency effort to predict losses of phosphorus, nitrogen, and sediment from individual fields using established water quality monitoring networks and simulation tools. Results may be scaled-up to examine broader scale effects and reasonable/achievable reductions that can be expected from targeted activities. Coordination among scientists, water quality specialists, and modelers in NRCS, USGS, EPA, and partnering universities is expected. Linkages between this work and ongoing Great Lakes efforts to establish target loads for subwatersheds (e.g., Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement) will be explored.\n<br /> &nbsp;",

        "body": "<h4>Description of Work<\/h4> USGS researchers have determined the densities of the eggs as these develop, and how much time the bighead and silver carp require to begin swimming and migrating laterally from flowing water into nursery habitat. This information about egg transport requirements was used to create a Tributary Assessment Tool also referred to as the Fluvial Egg Drift Simulator (FluEgg) model. The development of this tool was a collaborative effort between USGS and the University of Illinois. The tool takes into account the hydraulics of a river (water velocity and dispersion rates) and the water temperature (affects egg and larvae development rates) in order to determine if a river is sufficiently long and the velocities high enough for the eggs to be kept in suspension to develop into larvae.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Relevance/Benefits<\/h4> The biological and Asian carp life history research conducted by USGS has made significant contributions to understanding the development of bighead, silver and grass carp as well as how the development rate changes with water temperature. The resulting publications and datasets will help the entire scientific community in the study of Asian carp.\n<br /> The hydraulic and water-quality data collected on Great Lakes tributaries along with information about potential spawning locations and egg settling zones in reaches along the rivers help managers target locations and control measures in rivers where eggs may settle or Asian carp may spawn. The hydraulic data analysis from this project may also lead to control strategies such as determining placement of low-head dams to create settling zones that disrupt egg development but cause fewer ecological impacts than other control strategies such as poisons.\n<br /> The Tributary Assessment Tool developed in this project can be used by managers to efficiently identify Great Lakes tributaries that pose elevated risk for reproduction of bighead and silver carp by using hydraulic characteristics to simulate egg travel times and likelihood of eggs staying in suspension until development.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Key Findings<\/h4> \n<ul> \n <li>Asian carp can successfully spawn in rivers as short as 16 miles as opposed to the 62 mile length previously assumed to be the minimum.<\/li> \n <li>Asian carp eggs can stay suspended in rivers with velocities as low as 15-25 centimeters/second.<\/li> \n <li>Many more Great Lakes tributaries would be at risk of having Asian carp spawning and recruitment with the new understanding of the river length and flow requirements.<\/li> \n <li>o FluEgg outputs provide valuable insights into egg suspension and settlement by predicting the drifting behavior of the eggs based on river characteristics.<\/li> \n<\/ul>",
        "purpose": "This project focuses on determination of a minimum river length, water velocity, and water temperature characteristics required for spawning and growth of bighead and silver carp, in order to assess the risk of these carp becoming established in Great Lakes tributaries. This determination requires data collection on Asian carp life history traits and rivers likely to be vulnerable to Asian carp spawning. Information about the Asian carp eggs and larvae and river hydraulics is combined into a tributary assessment tool for determining risk of spawning and recruitment in rivers not yet affected by Asian carp. On rivers where Asian carp are already established, this tool can be used to target controls methods such as placement of egg settling zones or spawning disruptions.",

This is an extension of prior work at the site that has been used by the Manistique River and Harbor Remediation Team (comprised of managers and scientists from USEPA GLNPO, USEPA ORD, NOAA, USACOE, USGS and the state of Michigan) to guide plans for delisting activities. Riparian spiders are important mediators of contaminant flux from aquatic systems to nearby terrestrial habitats. Aquatic insects accumulate contaminants in their larval form, and transport these contaminants to terrestrial ecosystems in their adult bodies. Spiders are a key predator of aquatic insects, and many species feed almost exclusively on adult aquatic insects. Spider concentrations closely track ambient sediment concentrations, making them ideal indicators of ambient sediment concentrations and of ecosystem recovery from sediment remediation. Traditional species for contaminant exposure studies such as tetragnathid (long-jawed spiders) and araneid (orb-weaving spiders) will be targeted for these studies.\n<br /> &nbsp;",
        "purpose": "This project will quantify contaminant exposure in riparian food webs at Manistique River and Harbor AOC. These data will be used to evaluate BUIs, to evaluate the relationship between sediment contamination and adverse biological exposures, and to identify areas that require additional source control and or active remediation efforts. Research will focus on 12 sites spanning the AOC, with emphasis on areas that have been identified as potential ongoing sources. The goal of this work is to inform development of a conceptual site model as well as a feasibility study and remedial design plan that it so be enacted in ~FY14.",

This data will be used to evaluate the current ammonia criteria and for possible inclusion in the development of criteria for nitrite and nitrate. �",
        "body": "<h4>Description of Work<\/h4> Determine the relative sensitivity of two species of amphibians (i.e. Wood Frogs Rana sylvatica, Cricket Frogs Acris crepitans blanchardi, American Toad Bufo americana) to exposure to acute and chronic levels of nitrate, nitrite and ammonia. This data will be used to evaluate the current ammonia criteria and for possible inclusion in the development of criteria for nitrite and nitrate.\n<br /> &nbsp;",
        "purpose": "Region 5 is working with the States and Tribes to develop water quality criteria for nutrients.  Most of that work is focusing on the indirect effect nutrients have on aquatic communities through organic enrichment.  However, one of the Region 5 states recently began to review lab and field data to determine if one form of nitrogen may be having a direct toxic effect.  The available data reviewed by the state suggests that amphibians may be sensitive to chronic exposures of nitrate, and they appear to be one of the most sensitive groups of organisms tested.  Given that (1) human activities have increased the concentrations of numerous forms of nitrogen in the environment, (2) the form of nitrogen in the environment is dependant on human activities and natural processes that transform one form of nitrogen to another, and (3) the general lack of toxicity data for amphibians, this project will generate data for the three forms of nitrogen that are present in the environment and may cause toxicity to aquatic life (nitrate, nitrite and ammonia).  This information can be used by EPA, the Great Lakes States and Tribes in the development of water quality criteria to protect amphibians and other aquatic life and will be used to determine if existing criteria are sufficiently protective of this important group of aquatic animals.",

        "body": "<h4>Description of Work<\/h4> U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists are improving the health of the Great Lakes sport and commercial fisheries by documenting sources and the determining the processes that control mercury entering food webs, and helping to evaluate the implications for public health. Our scientists will provide decision-makers with a scientific understanding of mercury-source profiles, the relative importance of the various sources, and the expected environmental responses to Great Lakes wasters and fisheries to altered mercury loading and restoration actions. This information is intended to inform and maximize the benefit of the Great Lakes restoration program. The USGS will develop mercury and methylmercury mass budgets for all five Great Lakes. This information will aid resource managers to understand how various restoration actions will affect mercury conditions differently among the five Great Lakes. In the absence of this information, prescribing corrective measures, and their outcomes, for unsafe mercury levels in sport and commercial fish are very difficult to ascertain. In addition to source identification, this project quantifies mechanisms and rates of methylmercury degradation and atmosphere-lake exchange of gaseous mercury across all five Great Lakes. In FY 2014, efforts funded by this template will focus on science synthesis from the previous years of data collection, and to develop three manuscripts describing the new overall scientific understanding of mercury and methylmercury sources and cycling for the Great Lakes.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Relevance/Benefits<\/h4> Our scientists will provide decision makers with a scientific understanding of mercury processes that will help them to recommend actions that could help restore a healthier fishery. Elevated levels of mercury are observed in sport and commercial fish across the Great Lakes basin, which result in consumption advisories and beneficial use impairments. However, a good understanding of the primary sources and the factors regulating greater versus lesser levels of mercury in fish among the Great Lakes has remained unresolved.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Key Findings<\/h4> The study has identified two sources of methlymercury (the form of mercury in consumable fish) that were previously unrecognized - stream discharge was previously the only known source. The first is methylmercury formation in the water column of the lakes, and which has a controlling influence on the spatial distribution of methylmercury in surface waters of the Great Lakes. We have documented that in the nearshore zone where annually large masses of Cladophora (filamentous algae) wash ashore, significant methylmercury formation occurs. In combination, the robust data set and the new understanding of methylmercury sources for the Great Lakes will help inform decision makers and restoration managers on effective steps toward reducing fish mercury contamination. This project is linked to two other USGS and USEPA funded GLRI efforts to develop, for the first time a whole ecosystem (lakes and watersheds) model that will allow us to forecast responses of Great Lakes fish mercury levels to changes, such as: reduced mercury loading, changes in nutrient loading, and climate change.\n<br /> &nbsp;",
        "purpose": "The overall purpose of this project is to provided a substantially improved understanding of the key sources and processes controlling mercury levels in the food web of the Great Lakes, and to provide this information to restoration managers to help inform the decision-making process.",

Because the relative toxicity of major ions is highly variable, predicting effects based on conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS) or other composite measures may be simplistic. Furthermore, most of the available information on sensitivity of aquatic organisms to major ions has been derived from short-term laboratory toxicity tests conducted with surrogate species. There is relatively little information on the sensitivity of aquatic insects to elevated major ions. Field studies showed that abundance of mayflies (Ephemeroptera) was significantly lower in streams receiving elevated TDS associated with mountaintop removal and valley fill operations. Based on an extensive survey of central Appalachian streams, the U.S. EPA developed a benchmark for conductivity in areas affected by mountain top and valley fill operations. However, these analyses have been criticized because of the lack of experimental evidence showing that mayflies and other macroinvertebrates are sensitive to elevated major ions. These experiments will test the hypothesis that elevated levels of major ions will negatively impact benthic macroinvertebrate communities. Experiments will be conducted in stream microcosms to quantify responses of different groups of macroinvertebrates to elevated levels of major ions. The specific ions used in our experiments will be determined after consultation with EPA and USGS researchers.\n<br /> &nbsp;",
        "purpose": "Ultimately, these data will be used to identify sensitive indicators of TDS impacts and to assist in the determination of safe levels of major ions in aquatic ecosystems. This study will address 2 issues that are critical to the development and validation of standards for major ions associated with high TDS discharges. First, our community-level approach allows us to quantify effects under ecologically realistic conditions for numerous taxa simultaneously. This would contribute to our understanding of differences in sensitivity among macroinvertebrate taxa. Second, our approach allows us to investigate effects on very early instars, something that has been challenging in the previous research on these effluents. It is likely that the unrealistically high LC50 values reported for some species based on laboratory data are a result of conducting experiments with highly tolerant later instars.",

        "body": "<h4>Description of Work<\/h4> The GLRI Rivermouths Project (template 82) is designed to enhance our understanding of how rivermouths function at both regional and local scales by 1) developing a rivermouth classification system, based on a broad scale database covering all Great Lakes rivermouths (&gt;2000); 2) creating a science-based understanding of how the ecological structure and function of rivermouths are linked both to the landscapes they drain and to the Lakes with which they mix; and 3) increasing the public and scientific profile of these ecosystems by connecting researchers and natural resource managers through a collaborative dialog. The long-term goal is to provide enhanced guidance for restoration and rehabilitation of Great Lakes rivermouth processes, habitats, and services, and for planning of ecologically sustainable development in these highly-developed zones. Our efforts to interact with those organizing restoration activities at rivermouths has already resulted in active solicitation of our expertise by managers operating in several rivermouths (e.g., the Maumee and Au Sable rivermouths).\n<br /> \n<br /> Since project initiation in 2010, we have:\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<ul> \n <li>Completed six manuscripts, 5 published in peer-reviewed journals and 1 a report published by the Great Lakes Commission (see list below of papers published). Several other papers are in various states of preparation and review.<\/li> \n <li>Made substantial progress toward developing a Great Lakes Rivermouth classification system to guide synthesis of research on rivermouths as well as to help define ?reference conditions? in support of rivermouth restoration across the Great Lakes.<\/li> \n <li>Analyzed food web conditions and nutrient transformations in &gt;30 rivermouths sampled across the Great Lakes; initial results suggest that: \n  <ul> \n   <li>Rivermouths alter the relationship between agricultural sources of nitrogen (N) in watersheds and the N delivered to the nearshore of the Great Lakes. Rivermouths also appear to influence the delivery of other nutrients (e.g., phosphorus) and metals (e.g., iron, vanadium) to the nearshore zone. The magnitude of these effects appears to be related to the watershed and rivermouth characteristics.<\/li> \n   <li>Primary consumers (invertebrates) in rivermouths often contain far higher concentrations of essential fatty acids than their counterparts in the nearshore of the Great Lakes. These high-quality rivermouth invertebrates may provide an important food resource for highly mobile consumers (e.g., fish).<\/li> \n  <\/ul> <\/li> \n <li>In 2013 we began a program to map the spatial distribution and variation of several ecological processes across the western basin of Lake Erie (from the Maumee Rivermouth into the nearshore). These processes include secondary production and algal community composition: Essentially these are processes that support fish production and other ecosystem services.<\/li> \n <li>In 2013 we also continued analyzing data generated from previous years investigating the connection between rivermouth nutrients and open water food webs, as well as the spatial controls over riverine inputs to the nearshore.<\/li> \n<\/ul> &nbsp; \n<h4>Key Findings<\/h4> Made substantial progress toward developing a Great Lakes Rivermouth classification system to guide synthesis of research on rivermouths as well as to help define ?reference conditions? in support of rivermouth restoration across the Great Lakes.\n<br /> \n<br /> Analyzed food web conditions and nutrient transformations in &gt;30 rivermouths sampled across the Great Lakes; initial results suggest that:\n<br /> \n<br /> 1.

        "purpose": "Rivermouth ecosystems, or freshwater estuaries, are the focus of human and wildlife interactions with the Great Lakes.  They are highly valued as the region?s urban, industrial, shipping and recreational centers; and home to recreational harbors, wildlife viewing and production, beaches and urban riverfronts.  Rivermouths are also both the mixing zones where nutrients from upstream watersheds are incorporated into the Great Lakes ecosystem and important sites for fish nursery and passage to upstream spawning grounds.  These estuarine processes have been broadly altered through watershed land use, floodplain development, harbor channel dredging, wetland filling, urban stormwater, shoreline hardening, road and bridge construction, pier construction and the introduction of non-indigenous species.  Despite the importance of rivermouth ecosystems to humans, fish and wildlife, very little is known about how these ecosystems function or how anthropogenic changes have altered those natural processes.  Our lack of understanding severely limits our ability to manage or restore these ecosystems effectively and efficiently.  \nThe overall goal of this project is to link biological, hydrological and societal controls over rivermouth structure and function within an improved scientific framework that will form the basis for restoration, management and future research. To maximize usefulness, this framework will link rivermouth services (e.g., fish production, water quality) to important ecosystem processes, such as:  1) hydrogeomorphic influences, 2) distribution of habitat, 3)  relationships between rivermouth habitats and Great Lakes biota (in particular fish), 4)  structure and controls of food webs within rivermouths and the effects of upstream watersheds and 5) unique ecological and chemical processes that propagate the influence of rivermouths to the Great Lakes.  Furthermore, this framework will be widely distributed, accessible and responsive to resource managers and scientists working on other aspects of Great Lakes ecology.\n",

        "purpose": "To provide a 1-week training course for ''Geomorphic Analysis of Fluvial Systems'' to USEPA and other state and local agencies in Chicago, IL. The purpose of this course was to provide an introduction into the concepts of fluvial geomorphology and examples of geomorphic analysis, assessment, and monitoring.  The course touches on the multi-disciplinary areas of fluvial geomorphology which is strengthened by having five instructors with different speciality fields (Andrew Simon USDA-ARS, Allen Gellis USGS MD WSC, Jim O''Connor USGS OR WSC, Jonathan Friedman USGS-BRD, and Faith Fitzpatrick  USGS WI WSC). The course is a series of lectures and exercises, with an optional afternoon  field trip. Topics cover watershed processes, fluvial landforms, flow and sediment movement in channels, stream equilibrium, channel stability, riparian vegetation process and function, channel evolution, and geomorphic assessment and monitoring. After hours time was scheduled to promote informal discussions between instructors and students. Students are encouraged to bring and present a question or study if they are interested in getting some specific feedback from the instructors or other students.",

Nitrogen compounds pose a hazard to aquatic larval stages of amphibians, affecting survival and development, and inducing deformities and behavioral impairments. Declines in amphibian populations have been correlated with the prevalence of nitrogen-based fertilizer applications. Chronic toxicity studies conducted with ammonia determined that deformities and delayed development of R. pipiens, B. americanus, and R. clamitans resulted from chronic exposures conducted over the course of larval development to metamorphosis. Uncertainties posed by that study arose from inconsistent dosing as well as high control mortality. Limited testing suggests that water quality criteria for ammonia are likely to be protective of amphibians, yet limited information about the effects of exposure to stream dwelling amphibians and the consequences of sublethal injuries precludes verification.\n<br /> &nbsp;",

Plans by Federal, State and local partners to raise and widen an existing berm on Graham-McCulloch Ditch across Eagle Marsh and prevent Carp migration during floods depend on an understanding of how much water flows through streams that leave the marsh.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Key Findings<\/h4> Water-level, streamflow and water temperature measurements and in-person observations after storms in 2013 identified how the Wabash River basin intermittently connects with the Maumee Basin (Lake Erie) during flood events at and near Eagle Marsh such that adult Asian Carp, if present, could bypass the current berm structures.\n<br /> During some high water events, common carp were identified in the marsh in pooled water and at the temporary barrier fence. No Asian carp were observed.\n<br /> Flooding in Graham McCulloch Ditch and Junk Ditch during June 2013, after a local rainfall of about 4-5 inches rain/24 hours produced a brief, several day flow connection at Eagle Marsh during a period when water temperatures (?17-25 &deg;C) were potentially favorable to carp movement.\n<br /> Measurements on Junk Ditch identified how flood-related flows in the St. Mary?s River, a Maumee River tributary, reversed into Junk Ditch and into Eagle Marsh.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Products<\/h4> Indiana Department of Natural Resources&nbsp;website&nbsp;of description and photos of adult carp barrier:\n<br /> \n<br /> \n<a href=\"http://www.in.gov/portal/news_events/58486.htm\">http://www.in.gov/portal/news_events/58486.htm<\/a>\n<br /> \n<br /> Links to USGS water-level data&nbsp;at the adult carp barrier fence and streamflow and temperature data on either side of the basin divide:\n<br /> \n<br /> \n<a href=\"http://waterdata.usgs.gov/in/nwis/uv/?site_no=03323583&amp;PARAmeter_cd=00065,00060,00010\">03323583 EAGLE MARSH EAST NEAR FORT WAYNE, IN<\/a>\n<br /> \n<a href=\"http://waterdata.usgs.gov/in/nwis/uv/?site_no=03323584&amp;PARAmeter_cd=00065,00060,00010\">03323584 EAGLE MARSH WEST NEAR FORT WAYNE, IN<\/a>\n<br /> \n<a href=\"http://waterdata.usgs.gov/in/nwis/uv/?site_no=03323587&amp;PARAmeter_cd=00065,00060,00010\">03323587 GRAHAM MCCULLOCH DITCH NEAR FORT WAYNE, IN (Wabash River/Mississippi River basin)<\/a>\n<br /> \n<a href=\"http://waterdata.usgs.gov/in/nwis/uv/?site_no=04182755&amp;PARAmeter_cd=00065,00060,00010\">04182755 JUNK DITCH AT FORT WAYNE, IN (Maumee River/Lake Erie basin)<\/a>\n<br /> \n<br /> U.S. Army Corps of Engineers&nbsp;report&nbsp;on GLMRIS Aquatic Nuisance Species Controls:\n<br /> \n<br /> \n<a href=\"http://www.glmris.anl.gov/documents/docs/interim/Eagle_Marsh_ANS_Controls_Report.pdf\">Alternative H: Reconstruction of the Left Descending Graham-McCulloch Ditch Berm along the Eagle Marsh (pg.46) is similar to the basin separation remedy currently under design.<\/a>\n<br /> &nbsp;",
        "purpose": "Eagle Marsh has been classified as a high risk pathway for Asian Carp migration from the Wabash River to Lake Erie. Adult bighead carp have been confirmed in the Wabash River basin for at least 15 years. The Wabash River basin connects with the Maumee River basin (Lake Erie basin) through a former glacial channel at Eagle Marsh in northeast Indiana during floods that occur after heavy rains and snowmelt. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources, Little River Wetland Project and Federal partners built a temporary adult carp barrier fence across a part of Eagle Marsh in 2010 to prevent movement of adult Asian Carp into the St. Mary?s and Maumee Rivers from the Wabash River when Eagle Marsh floods.\n\nReal-time alerts of water levels were needed to indicate flooding conditions so that fence inspections could take place, identifying the presence or absence of adult Asian Carp in Eagle Marsh. Real-time information about water levels, streamflow directions and water temperatures was also needed in waterways that connect Eagle Marsh with the Wabash and Maumee River basins. This information is essential to designing permanent Asian Carp barriers that preserve use of the marsh as habitat and local flood relief, but prevent the expansion of this invasive species.\n",

        "body": "<h4>Description of Work<\/h4> U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) will use remote sensing data to establish a baseline understanding of current distributions of invasive wetland plants and then forecast potential invasion corridors. Alterations to the Great Lakes shoreline or water-level patterns associated with global climate change could have significant impacts on the extent and composition of coastal habitat. Low lake levels can expose fertile wetland bottomlands to invasive species such as common reed ( \n<em>Phragmites<\/em>).\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Goals &amp; Objectives<\/h4> \n<strong>Goals:<\/strong> \n<ul> \n <li>Identify current <em>Phragmites<\/em> distribution in the Great Lakes coastal zone,<\/li> \n <li>detect potential areas vulnerable to invasion due to influences such as altered water levels, nutrient and sediment loading, and shoreline development, and<\/li> \n <li>communicate project results to researchers, managers, policy makers, and the general public to guide future management and restoration efforts throughout the Great Lakes basin.<\/li> \n<\/ul> \n<br /> \n<strong>Objectives:<\/strong> \n<ul> \n <li>Use remote sensing to map the current extent of <em>Phragmites<\/em> in the Great Lakes coastal zone,<\/li> \n <li>assess areas vulnerable to the spread of <em>Phragmites<\/em> under predicted climate-change scenarios and environmental influences (e.g., nutrients, hydrology, shoreline development), and<\/li> \n <li>give presentations, write a USGS fact sheet, create a web-based decision-support tool, and begin work toward communicating project results to the public and decision makers verbally and in journal publications.<\/li> \n<\/ul> &nbsp; \n<h4>Relevance/Benefits<\/h4> The basin-wide map of current \n<em>Phragmites<\/em> distribution that will be produced will be useful to natural resource managers and will provide a basis for basin-wide efforts to control&nbsp; \n<em>Phragmites<\/em>, especially in areas where preservation of native biodiversity is particularly important. As nothing like this currently exists, such a map will prove invaluable for controlling the spread of this invasive species. Wetlands with previously undiscovered stands of \n<em>Phragmites<\/em> will be identified, and restoration efforts can be directed at these areas. Predicting corridors for future invasion by assessing vulnerability of exposed bottomlands to expansion will allow managers to target and prioritize control efforts, especially in relation to current coastal wetland restoration efforts.\n<br /> \n<br /> This project addresses mission, vision, and multiple priorities identified in the USGS Strategic Plan and the USGS ? Great Lakes Science Center Strategic Plan. It is consistent with the U.S. Climate Change Science Program strategic goals, the research goals of multiple programs within USGS (i.e., Ecosystems, Invasive Species, Fisheries: Aquatic and Endangered Resources), and initiatives endorsed by the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration. The USGS ? Great Lakes Science Center (USGS ? GLSC) has the mission, staff, facilities, and equipment to lead the cutting-edge research involved in this basin-wide effort.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Approach<\/h4> \n<strong><em>Phragmites<\/em>&nbsp;Mapping<\/strong>&nbsp;- A map of the current \n<em>Phragmites<\/em> distribution along the U.S. Great Lakes coastal zone (10-km buffer inland from shore) will be generated and published as a web-based decision-support tool.\n<br /> \n<br /> 1. Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF) will procure the 260 multi-temporal radar imagery scenes (dual-polarized ALOS PALSAR) necessary to map the U.S. Great Lakes shoreline and will georegister the scenes to within 1-2 pixels.\n<br /> \n<br /> 2. Using the georectified scenes, Michigan Tech Research Institute (MTRI) will map current extent of \n<em>Phragmites<\/em> by basin using algorithms developed and tested for this purpose.\n<br /> \n<br /> 3. Ground-truthing of the mapping effort will be performed by MTRI. Field crews will collect pre-selected GPS points and digital photos of \n<em>Phragmites<\/em> and other vegetation and will transmit these data to MTRI image analysts through a Google Earth field tracking system.\n<br /> \n<br /> 4. Preliminary maps of each basin will be distributed via a web-based tool supported by USGS Center for Integrated Data Analytics (CIDA) under a separate GLRI project. Validation by MTRI of maps to 95% confidence using ground-truth data will begin in FY10 and will be finalized in FY11.\n<br /> \n<br /> \n<strong>Vulnerability Assessment (Predicting Corridors of Expansion)<\/strong>&nbsp;- To understand the large-scale factors influencing&nbsp; \n<em>Phragmites<\/em> distribution, GIS analyses and statistical methods will be used to relate current \n<em>Phragmites<\/em> extent to variables such as, but not limited to, slope and topography, nutrient loading to the coastal zone, proximity to urban and agricultural land-use types, shoreline development, and water depth. The major influencing factors will be used to develop a GIS modeling framework to identify areas vulnerable to invasion. Using these FY10 results, FY11 efforts will advance prediction of \n<em>Phragmites<\/em> expansion in the coastal zone given the water-level scenarios of current climate-change models.\n<br /> \n<br /> 1. USGS -GLSC will obtain LIDAR non-bare earth topographic and bathymetric data as 1-m DEMs from NOAA Coastal Services Center and USACE Joint Airborne Lidar Bathymetry Technical Center of Expertise (JALBTCX). Other bathymetric data sources will be researched and acquired, if available, for the shoreline extent from Cleveland, OH to Port Huron, MI, where turbidity precluded collection of LIDAR data.\n<br /> \n<br /> 2. The bathymetric data will be converted to slopes and water-depth contours for a 0.5 m, 1.0 m, and 1.5 m drop in water level or other relevant water-level scenarios determined by downscaled climate models. LIDAR data also will be analyzed for geomorphic obstructions (e.g., bluffs) to \n<em>Phragmites<\/em> expansion. Substrate data will be requested from USACE. A GIS data layer of land use will be generated from the publicly available MIRIS data set. Tributary nutrient-load data and nutrient data from the SPAtially Referenced Regressions On Watershed attributes (SPARROW) model will be acquired from USGS CIDA and the USGS Wisconsin Water Science Center, respectively. Water-level data will be obtained from the NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory website and converted to depth using the LIDAR bathymetric data.\n<br /> \n<br /> 3. General linear modeling and regression analysis will be used to determine significant relationships, if any, between current&nbsp; \n<em>Phragmites<\/em> occurrence and the above environmental variables (slope, topography, nutrient and sediment loading, land use, shoreline development, water depth, water-level fluctuation).\n<br /> \n<br /> 4. To identify areas vulnerable to invasion, we first will map potential wetland area for four water-level scenarios predicted by downscaled climate models or predetermined (i.e., current 2009 levels and a 0.5 m, 1.0 m, and 1.5 m drop in water level). The following two criteria will be used to identify potential wetland area: 1) being at an elevation where mean high water level is between 0.1 m and 2 m and 2) having a substrate other than bedrock. Vulnerable areas will be identified as regions within the potential wetland area with a slope appropriate for&nbsp; \n<em>Phragmites<\/em> growth (as identified in #3 above) and with a topographic corridor linking it to the current&nbsp; \n<em>Phragmites<\/em> population. Highly vulnerable areas will be identified where nutrients, shoreline development, or other significant variables suggest greater probability for \n<em>Phragmites<\/em> expansion.\n<br /> \n<br /> 5. The vulnerability maps for each of the water-level scenarios will be published alongside the&nbsp; \n<em>Phragmites&nbsp;<\/em>map in the web-based tool. Users will be able to overlay water-level contours for each of the scenarios as well as sites identified as biodiversity protection areas by The Nature Conservancy and other organizations.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Key Outcomes<\/h4> 1. Through a cooperative effort with Michigan Tech Research Institute (MTRI), a spatial analyst lab, we used satellite data (PALSAR) to create a basin-wide map of \n<em>Phragmites<\/em> in the Great Lakes. The mapping effort also was supported by GLRI funds from the USFWS. The basin-wide map of the US coastal zone shows variability in the distribution of&nbsp; \n<em>Phragmites<\/em>, with certain regions (e.g., western Lake Erie, southern Lake Huron, Green Bay of Lake Michigan) supporting extensive&nbsp; \n<em>Phragmites<\/em>. This mapping product represents mature invasive \n<em>Phragmites<\/em>&nbsp;stands that are 0.2 ha or larger. Map accuracy was determined using an extensive network of field validation points. The type of data and analysis methods used do not easily map the native \n<em>Phragmites<\/em> or sparse stands at the expansion front.\n<br /> \n<br /> 2. Many climate models for the Great Lakes predict lower lake levels, which can expose fertile wetland bottomlands to invasive species such as \n<em>Phragmites<\/em>. Using LIDAR data that were collected as part of a NOAA GLRI project, we determined what bottomlands may be exposed under reduced lake-level scenarios and become potential corridors for \n<em>Phragmites<\/em> invasion. We performed a simple vulnerability analysis related to proximity to current \n<em>Phragmites<\/em> stands to assist managers with early detection and control.\n<br /> \n<br /> 3. We have preliminary results from a more rigorous vulnerability analysis that involves compiling large-scale, GIS-based environmental drivers for the Great Lakes basin and relating them to current \n<em>Phragmites<\/em> distribution. This represents a new frontier in large-scale \n<em>Phragmites<\/em>&nbsp;ecology that has never before been performed. Preliminary results indicate that three primary variables (i.e., nitrogen concentration, proximity to agriculture, and population density) are associated with extensive invasive \n<em>Phragmites<\/em> stands. Using species distribution modeling, we are using key environmental variables and data on the mapped \n<em>Phragmites<\/em> to create a spatial habitat suitability index that indicates areas that are highly vulnerable to \n<em>Phragmites<\/em> invasion. This vulnerability map can be used by managers for early detection, monitoring, and control, especially in areas being restored under the GLRI.\n<br /> \n<br /> 4. Scientists from the USGS Great Lakes Science Center worked with staff at the USGS Center for Integrated Data Analytics to make the mapping data available to the public using the GLRI GeoNetwork. The GeoNetwork is primarily a metadata catalog that describes the availability and structure of geospatial data sets produced by GLRI projects but also supports the graphical interpretation of these products through interactive maps that allow users to view and print depictions of available data at custom scales ( \n<a href=\"https://cida.usgs.gov/glri/geonetwork/srv/en/main.home\">https://cida.usgs.gov/glri/geonetwork/srv/en/main.home<\/a>). An online decision support tool is being developed to allow users to access the mapping and modeling data produced in this study.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Products<\/h4> \n<strong>Poster Presentations<\/strong>\n<br /> Galbraith, D., M.

        "body": "<h4>Description of Work<\/h4> Since the early 2000s, the LaMP has proposed adding nutrients (specifically phosphorus) to its ?pollutant of concern? list, given that excessive nutrients were believed to cause impairments in the nearshore waters. Since that time, scientists have highlighted the ?shunting? of nutrients to the nearshore, owing to the ability of invasive dreissenid mussels to capture some portion of allochthanous phosphorus that enters the lake through tributaries. These changes are believed to underlie a series of changes in the nearshore, including increased biomass of cladophora and hypothesized increases in benthic and pelagic biomass, including zooplankton and fish. As an extension, this model proposes the offshore is receiving fewer nutrients than in previous decades, when 1) phosphorus inputs were higher and 2) dreissenid mussels were not present to sequester the phosphorus. Understanding the distribution and abundance of nutrients and biota (e.g., invertebrates, fish) across a nearshore to offshore gradient remains a key knowledge gap identified by the Lake Michigan LAMP and fishery management community. Increased understanding and knowledge of the Lake Michigan nearshore will facilitate the development of a Nearshore Strategy by the LAMP, which is called for in the 2012 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement.\n<br /> \n<br /> This project seeks to improve understanding of the food-web linkages between nearshore and offshore with a design that samples eight nearshore-to-offshore transects, with water, plankton, benthos, and fish being sampled at 18, 46, and &gt;100 m bottom depth at each transect. This design builds on sampling only 2 transects (but with greater temporal frequency) in coordination with the 2010 CSMI year. Results from that work indicated that the nearshore zone was not necessarily more productive than deeper waters, opposite from conventional knowledge of Great Lakes ecosystems. Hence the 2015 sampling design has been modified to emphasize broader spatial coverage. Furthermore, the 2015 design locates transects along a gradient of proximity to tributary inputs of phosphorus (from adjacent to high-loading tributaries, such as the St. Joseph River, to adjacent to no tributaries, such as offshore of Arcadia, Michigan). Sampling of transects will occur in spring, summer, and autumn, and we are coordinating with other agencies to describe patterns in areas shallower or deeper than our sampling design. We also would welcome collaboration with others to add sampling transects in the northern basin of the lake. Key questions being addressed include 1) How does nutrient availability change from nearshore to offshore and how is that availability influenced by proximity to tributary inputs?, 2) How well does productivity of phytoplankton within a given habitat correspond to productivity of zooplankton and fish?, 3) Does the physiological condition of prey fish change from nearshore to offshore or with proximity to tributary inputs?, 4) What is the biomass of fish predicted from size spectrum modeling and how does this compare to other Great Lakes?\n<br /> &nbsp;",

        "body": "<h4>Description of Work<\/h4> In 2011, the US EPA, USGS, and Canada?s DFO/EC continued the evolution of the strategy to conduct an ?integrated? (water quality to fish) spatially-consistent assessment for the entire lake in order to provide biomass estimates for each trophic level. A total of 54 sites were sampled during summer 2011. Water chemistry, nutrients, phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, Mysis, and pelagic and benthic fish were collected at each site.\n<br /> &nbsp;",
        "purpose": "The study was designed to achieve the following overall results:\n1. Provide lake-wide assessment using a consistent statistical survey design for major components of water quality and food web; analyses to include abundance and biomass estimates, with defined statistical confidence levels.  Information will allow an unprecedented integration of results across the whole lake without biases and limitations inherent in currently uncoordinated and non-comprehensive efforts across the Great Lakes.\n2. Reveal biological/ecological patterns over depth. Information will be useful to illustrate ecological distinctions as a function of water depth, including in water quality and across the food web community.\n3. Provide a basis for statistical modeling to optimize lake-wide sampling for future defined objectives.  Information will be used to quantify what sampling effort and spatial allocation will satisfy specific lake-wide monitoring objectives (including changes over space or time) for an array of water quality and biology parameters.\n4. Provide insight on the relative stability of the Lake Superior food web, including an ability to explore critical linkages and spatial scales of interaction with the physico-chemical environment.  The integrated, lake-wide data offers a sound foundation to track long-term changes and/or assist development of ecological forecasting models for managers to develop ecosystem-based protection and restoration strategies. \n\nThrough sampling of 54 sites during summer 2011, we were able to provide statistically-sound whole lake estimates of abundance and biomass of plankton, benthos, Mysis, and major pelagic and benthic fish species.  In general, lake-wide confidence intervals were in a satisfactory range for comparative analyses.  Confidence intervals varied across components. Water quality measures generally had low spatial variability whereas fish (as a community) and individual taxa (like Diporeia or individual fish species) had the highest levels of variability.       \nExamples of biological patterns showed some populations with strong bias to inshore (benthos, Diporeia, pelagic fish) and some with strong bias to offshore (Mysis); but there were a variety of different patterns across taxa.  There were semi-distinct inshore and offshore communities in terms of species distributions, abundance and biomass. But there were also transitional environments and a depth-based progression of species, with populations overlapping between shallow and deep water communities.\n\nSuccessful statistical modeling to date has produced results to identify the expected level of ?precision? (i.e., statistical confidence intervals) with differing levels of sampling effort than we conducted, i.e., with both less and more numbers of sites).   The analyses will be an effective guide to future assessments at the lake-wide scale.  Modeling efforts on spatial allocation strategies are still in progress.",

        "body": "<h4>Description of Work<\/h4> The study will be implemented in two phases due to logistical constraints and the need to incorporate methods developed (and findings) from a comparable investigation underway in another AOC. The first phase will consist of site selection, methods refinement, work-plan development, subcontract assembly, site reconnaissance, and sediment collection which will be done mainly during FY2013. The second phase will consist of macroinvertebrate identification, sediment toxicity testing, data analysis and interpretation, and report preparation and review mainly during FY2014. In brief, we will generate bed sediment toxicity and benthic community data needed to test two related hypotheses that address the two criteria for delisting the benthos BUI. The first hypothesis is that bed sediments at selected sample locations in the AOC are no more toxic to the test species than bed sediments collected from reference (control) sites located outside the AOC. Acute (survival) and chronic (growth) whole bed-sediment toxicity tests will be conducted using the midge (Chironomus dilutus), following standard methods (USEPA 1994; USEPA 2000). The second hypothesis is that the benthic macroinvertebrate communities from targeted sites within the AOC are not significantly different, or are affected (impacted) no more seriously than the communities encountered at reference sites located outside the AOC according to spatial patterns in benthic community composition (nonparametric ordination) and the Biological Assessment Profile (BAP) index and component metrics for Ponar samples collected from soft bed sediments (fig. 1) developed by NY State Department of Environmental Conservation (Bode et al. 2002; Smith et al. 2009). The component metrics of the BAP include: SPP (species richness), HBI (Hilsenhoff Biotic Index), DOM3 (Dominance-3), PMA (Percent Model Affinity), and DIV (species diversity). The mean score of the five indices denotes the overall BAP and associated impact for each site. Although several bed sediment-collection methods are suitable, the Petite Ponar sampler will be used to collect 5 replicate macroinvertebrate-community samples and a single composite sample for bed sediment toxicity tests at each study site. Bed-sediment sizes will be characterized by either the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Sediment Laboratory or NYSDEC subcontract laboratory using a subsample (split) obtained from the composite bed sediment-toxicity sample. Statistical analyses and multivariate (ordination) methods will be used to test the two hypotheses and to determine if the bed sediments within the St. Lawrence River at Massena AOC meet either criterion for delisting the benthos BUI.\n<br /> &nbsp;",
        "purpose": "The main objective of this study is to determine if the plankton and benthos beneficial uses are currently impaired in parts of the Rochester Embayment AOC. Benthic invertebrate community, sediment toxicity, and water toxicity results will be used specifically to test whether water and bed sediments in the Rochester Embayment AOC meet established criteria for delisting either or both BUIs. Work funded by this template will gather data that will support the removal of Beneficial Use Impairments but will not directly remove them.",

We will also assess feeding behaviors by sampling food particles from areas with telemetry-tagged fish, at random sites and in Asian carp stomachs. Food from these sources will be characterized with a particle analyzer, genetics and microscopy to determine preferences and limitations in regards to particle size, shape, and algae and zooplankton composition. To determine environmental conditions that might affect recruitment of Asian carp, we will assess larval and juvenile Asian carp habitat needs and potential predators by sampling with electrofishing boats, nets, and remote sensing (use of pit-tags and telemetry) in managed and natural flood-plain wetlands. Stomach samples from potential predators will be analyzed with microscopy and genetics to determine whether they ingest Asian carp. Potential predators identified from field studies will be evaluated in controlled experiments to assess relative predator effectiveness and juvenile Asian carp habitat selection under various environmental conditions of predator density, depth, turbidity, and vegetation abundance.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Relevance/Benefits<\/h4> Information from these studies will fill gaps in and refine existing knowledge on the life cycle of Asian carps in North America that will speed the development of safe and effective control measures in systems with established and emerging Asian carp populations. The control measures developed with this new information will target specific life stages of Asian carp and include species-specific chemical controls, selective removal by fishing, barriers at strategic locations, lethal egg and larvae settling zones, artificial (false) spawning sites near existing egg and larvae settling zones, predator stocking, and other habitat manipulations detrimental to recruitment.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Key Findings<\/h4> Findings will be reported as the project progresses.\n<br /> &nbsp;",
        "purpose": "Novel Asian carp control methods are currently in development, however, many of these approaches cannot be implemented in a safe and effective manner without additional information on Asian carp life-cycle traits. For example, chemical control agents that target Asian carp will need to be deployed in locations and in a manner such that Asian carp take up these chemicals, but native species do not. Similarly, the effectiveness of other novel control approaches such as habitat manipulation or predator stocking cannot be estimated without better understanding Asian carp habitat use and vulnerability to predators. For example, little is known about the environmental conditions necessary for successful recruitment of juvenile Asian carps to adult age classes. Restrictive conditions might include the suitability of habitats for adult spawning or for juvenile development, survival and growth. Manipulating these critical habitats or targeting them with chemicals or predators could lead to reduced Asian carp recruitment. To control and prevent the spread of Asian carp in North American, these life history traits need to be understood not only in systems where Asian carp are well established, but also at invasion fronts where their numbers are still low.",

        "purpose": "Chemical stimuli play a critical role in the performance of essential life functions in many fishes, including Asian carp, where chemical stimuli provide important information to seek favorable habitats, locate food, and find other carp for schooling, avoiding predators, and synchronizing sexual readiness within the population. These stimuli can also induce specific behaviors such as attraction and spawning behaviors. Sex pheromones can be induced through hormonal treatments. Repellant alarm pheromones offer carp protection from predation and aggregating pheromones attract carp to schools. Selection and location of planktonic food sources are largely based on chemical cues. Field studies are required to evaluate the effectiveness of chemical stimuli as an attractant and repellant to aid in the capture of wild carp. Technologies need to be identified for observing the response of wild carp to attractive and repellant stimuli in the field.",

        "body": "<h4>Description of Work<\/h4> The first objective of this project is to restore Atlantic salmon in Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River through development of new and innovative restoration techniques and evaluation of multiple salmon strains to determine their suitability for restoration. A primary focus of Atlantic salmon restoration is to evaluate survival of new strains of salmon stocked into Lake Ontario. As part of this project, the Sebago strain is being stocked into the lake and other strains are being considered for use based on life history characteristics and egg availability. This approach includes acquisition of Atlantic salmon eggs, rearing of salmon to various life stages (fry, fingerlings, smolts), marking, and post-stocking evaluation. The UV treatment facility at the USGS Tunison Laboratory of Aquatic Science has allowed researchers to acquire and rear Atlantic salmon eggs collected from the wild without risk of disease transfer, such as viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS). Scientists have identified salmon release locations with the highest probability for success of capturing returning adult salmon, a critical part of establishing a Lake Ontario egg source to perpetuate the project. The first releases of Atlantic salmon into Lake Ontario have already occurred, with additional releases planned in the near future.\n<br /> \n<br /> The second objective of this project is to restore deepwater cisco and lake herring in Lake Ontario through development of new and innovative restoration techniques and evaluation of the suitability of historic spawning sites. Deepwater cisco and lake herring were once among the most abundant fish in Lake Ontario, serving as important prey for native salmon and lake trout, and supporting commercial fisheries. Lake Ontario populations of deepwater cisco and lake herring declined by the mid-1900s due to invasive species, and deepwater cisco went extinct from the lake by the 1970s, although populations still persisted in the upper Great Lakes (lakes Superior, Michigan, and Huron). Restoration of deepwater cisco and lake herring in Lake Ontario has previously been hampered by an inability to obtain eggs from the upper Great Lakes for reintroduction into Lake Ontario, due to the lack of an isolation facility for rearing the eggs. The new UV treatment facility at the USGS Tunison Laboratory of Aquatic Science now allows researchers to overcome this obstacle. Deepwater cisco and lake herring eggs from stocks in the upper Great Lakes were acquired at the start of this project, and the first releases of these important native fishes into Lake Ontario have already occurred. All stocked fish were marked with an elastomer dye, which allows researchers to evaluate post-stocking success. Restoration of lake herring is also focusing on current suitability and enhancement potential of historic spawning grounds.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Relevance/Benefits<\/h4> Restoration of Atlantic salmon, deepwater cisco, and lake herring will require, at least for the short-term (10-20 years), stocking of hatchery-raised fish, which entails a cooperative, international effort among federal, state, and provincial agencies. Through GLRI funding, a new UV treatment facility was constructed at the USGS Tunison Laboratory of Aquatic Science, providing state-of-the-art capabilities for holding wild-captured eggs and raising fish for release. Reintroduction of Atlantic salmon will provide greater fishing opportunities in Lake Ontario and restore the natural balance of the Lake Ontario food web through providing additional top predators. Reintroduction of the native prey fish species, deepwater cisco and lake herring, will increase food choices and enhance the natural recruitment potential of predator fish, including Atlantic salmon and lake trout. Restoration of native fish is also expected to mitigate previous effects of invasive species, such as alewife and rainbow smelt, and reduce opportunities for new invasive species to colonize the lake by increasing food web resistance to invasion.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Key Findings<\/h4> Reintroduction of Atlantic salmon will provide greater fishing opportunities in Lake Ontario and restore the natural balance of the Lake Ontario food web through providing additional top predators.

Approximately 138,000 fall fingerling Atlantic salmon were raised and released in Lake Ontario tributaries during fall of 2011 and 2012. Another 15,000 fall fingerling Atlantic salmon were released in St. Lawrence River tributaries during fall of 2011 and 2012 in partnership with the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe. An additional 10,000 yearling Atlantic salmon smolts were released in Lake Ontario tributaries during spring 2012.\n<br /> \n<br /> Deepwater cisco eggs were collected in February 2012 from Lake Michigan. Approximately 1,200 fall fingerling deepwater cisco were stocked in Lake Ontario off Oswego, New York during fall of 2012. Collaborative efforts between the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and USGS Tunison Laboratory of Aquatic Science resulted in collection of approximately 70 adult lake herring in Lake Ontario during winter of 2011-12. The USGS Tunison Lab raised and stocked approximately 10,000 fall fingerling lake herring in Lake Ontario embayments during winter of 2012-13. Post-stocking monitoring will occur to evaluate restoration success.\n<br /> &nbsp;",
        "purpose": "The USGS is taking an innovative approach to restoration, simultaneously restoring native fish species at two different food web levels in Lake Ontario. Historically, the Lake Ontario population of Atlantic salmon represented the largest freshwater population of salmon in the world. Overfishing and loss of spawning habitat has since led to their extirpation. Two deepwater whitefishes, deepwater cisco (also known as bloater; Coregonus hoyi) and lake herring (C. artedi), have also experienced dramatic declines in Lake Ontario due to effects of invasive species, such as alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordox). This GLRI project is focused on restoring Atlantic salmon, deepwater cisco, and lake herring in Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River, marking a first-of-its-kind effort in the region. This project is the critical first step in restoring a resilient native fish community in Lake Ontario, strengthening both the local ecosystem and local economy.",

Not only do quagga and zebra mussels harm native mussels, they also disrupt the entire aquatic food change with potentially devastating effects to multiple fish species, including sport fish.\n<br /> \n<br /> Ecologists at the \n<a href=\"http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/research_collections/research/labs/fieldlab/index.html\">New York State Museum Field Research Laboratory<\/a>(NYSM) discovered a strain of the common soil bacterium \n<em>Pseudomonas fluorescens<\/em> ( \n<em>Pf<\/em>-CL145A) originally isolated from river sediments in North America that had selective activity against zebra mussels. Early in this process, NYSM scientists discovered that killed cells of \n<em>Pf<\/em>-CL145A had similarly activity as live \n<em>Pf-<\/em>CL145A cells against dreissenid mussels, thus all future studies and development will be completed using killed cells of \n<em>Pf<\/em>-CL145A. When ingested by filter-feeding zebra and quagga mussels, a cellular component of \n<em>Pf<\/em>-CL145A targets the digestive gland of dreissenid mussels , ultimately resulting in their death. As part of the development of the \n<em>Pf<\/em>-CL145A killed-cell product at NYSM, a series of non-target laboratory and mesocosm trials were conducted to assess its specificity to zebra and quagga mussels. These acute toxicity trials included a variety of aquatic organisms, including a freshwater ciliate \n<em>Colpidium colpoda<\/em>, zooplankton \n<em>Daphnia magna<\/em>, freshwater amphipod \n<em>Hyalella azteca<\/em>, bluegill \n<em>Lepomis macrochirus<\/em>, fathead minnow \n<em>Pimephales promelas<\/em>, brown trout \n<em>Salmo trutta<\/em>, blue mussels \n<em>Mytilus edulis<\/em> and adult unionids Eastern elliptio \n<em>Elliptio complanata<\/em>, Eastern lampmussel \n<em>Lampsilis radiata<\/em>, creek heelsplitter \n<em>Lasmigona compressa<\/em>, giant floater \n<em>Pyganodon grandis<\/em>, creeper \n<em>Strophitus undulates<\/em>, Eastern floater \n<em>Pyganodon cataracta<\/em>. Significant mortality in these non-target organisms did not occur even when exposed to levels of the Pf-CL145A killed-cell product that was lethal to zebra mussels (i.e., exposed animal mortality did not differ from that of untreated controls).\n<br /> \n<br /> The \n<em>Pf<\/em>-CL145A killed-cell product is currently being developed as the commercial product \n<a href=\"http://marronebioinnovations.com/products/zequanox/\">Zequanox?<\/a> by Marrone Bio Innovations (MBI; Davis, CA). It was registered by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on July 29, 2011 to control dreissenid mussels in defined discharges. Studies, including those to assess potential human health risks, were completed by MBI and reviewed by EPA as part of the registration process. Living cells of \n<em>Pf<\/em>-CL145A (technically the active ingredient) applied to rats through the skin (dermal), in feed (oral), and by inhalation caused no adverse effect and were non-pathogenic to rats. One measure of toxicity, the oral LD50 (the dose expected to be lethal to 50% of the exposed population) had a value of &gt;5000 mg/kg, placing \n<em>Pf<\/em>-CL145A in the lowest risk category for pesticide products. The EPA concluded from the available information that Zequanox? to be \n<a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/stprf.htm#some\">?tolerance exempt ?<\/a>, one of the highest safety levels assigned by EPA to pesticide products.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Description of Work<\/h4> This project, funded through a competitive grant award from the \n<a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/glnpo/glri/\">EPA's Great Lakes Restoration Initiative<\/a> and through appropriated funds from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), is a collaborative effort between the NYSM, the USGS Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center (UMESC) and the USFWS \n<a href=\"http://www.fws.gov/midwest/genoa/\">Genoa National Fish Hatchery<\/a> (GNFH). The project is independent of MBI in all aspects other than providing Zequanox? for experimental use and does not receive funding from any non-profit organizations or state natural resource agencies. Though \n<em>Pf<\/em>-CL145A has proven effective in experiments designed to evaluate its use to control dreissenid mussels in pipes, little research has been conducted to evaluate its potential for controlling existing dreissenid mussel populations in open waters or to prevent the distribution of dreissenid mussel veligers in transported water (i.e., the water in a fish hatchery distribution truck). Comprehensive research is required to determine the potential of \n<em>Pf<\/em>-CL145A as a dreissenid management tool for natural aquatic habitats. Determining this potential may ultimately allow this emerging technology to be used to support ecosystem restoration and rehabilitation efforts in and around the Great Lakes. The three objectives of this project are to:\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<ul> \n <li>Evaluate the acute toxicity of the <em>Pf<\/em>-CL145A commercial product formulations on freshwater fish and unionids from the Great Lakes and Mississippi River.<\/li> \n <li>Prevent the spread of dreissenids by developing and demonstrating treatment protocols to use the <em>Pf<\/em>-CL145A-based product to kill 100% of the planktonic larvae (veligers) in contained systems such as fish transport water and within fish hatcheries.<\/li> \n <li>Develop application methods for using <em>Pf<\/em>-CL145A to reduce dreissenid populations within native unionid restoration structures and within native unionid beds.

Not only will these trials expand the sensitivity information already available for Pf-CL145A by testing more species of fish and unionids, but also by obtaining the first evaluation of the sensitivity of early life stages of native fish (&lt;1 year-old) and unionids (i.e., glochidia and juvenile [&lt;48-h post glochidia stage] mussels). This critical information will allow unionid conservationists to make informed choices on whether, when, and how to apply this tool to reduce potential impacts on unionids or their fish hosts. The toxicity trials will be conducted at UMESC with mussels (and mussel propagation expertise) provided by GNFH. The acute toxicity of the commercial product formulation of \n<em>Pf<\/em>-CL145A to fish and unionids will be assessed following standard testing guidelines for acute toxicity testing wherever possible and will conform to the strict data recording procedures required by Good Laboratory Practice regulations. The information developed in these trials will be essential for potential users of this tool to make informed management decisions as part of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programs to limit dreissenid mussel populations and support unionid conservation and restoration efforts.\n<br /> \n<br /> \n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/projects/invasive_species/images/fish_table.jpg\" />\n<br /> \n<br /> \n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/projects/invasive_species/images/unionid_table.jpg\" />\n<br /> \n<br /> \n<strong>Objective 2<\/strong>: Prevent the spread of dreissenids by developing and demonstrating treatment protocols using the \n<em>Pf<\/em>-CL145A-based product to kill 100% of the planktonic larvae (veligers) in contained systems such as fish transport water or within fish hatcheries.\n<br /> \n<br /> Once established in a water body, dreissenid mussels are virtually impossible to eradicate without affecting the entire ecosystem. Therefore, preventing the spread of zebra and quagga mussels is the most effective and safest means of control. The larval stages of dreissenids, including the feeding veliger stage, are microscopic and swim suspended in the water column for up to three weeks before settling on surfaces on lake or river bottoms. Water containing these larval planktonic dreissenids can inadvertently be transferred to new water bodies by recreational users (i.e., in live wells and bait buckets). Although many fish hatchery managers treat transfer water with salt solutions to kill dreissenid larvae, having another tool to eliminate these larvae from the water without harming the organisms being transferred (e.g. fish or unionids) would be beneficial. Preliminary experiments indicate that dreissenid veligers are even more susceptible to the \n<em>Pf<\/em>-CL145A-based product than are attached stages (i.e., juvenile and adult mussels). The NYSM will develop and demonstrate (at bench scales) easy-to-implement veliger treatment protocols. Those protocols will then be ?field? tested in collaboration with UMESC and GNFH by evaluating the treatments in commonly used fish transfer units.\n<br /> \n<br /> \n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/projects/invasive_species/images/zm_veligers3.jpg\" /> \n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/projects/invasive_species/images/zm_veligers4.jpg\" />\n<br /> \n<br /> \n<strong>Objective 3<\/strong>: Develop application methods for using \n<em>Pf<\/em>-CL145A to reduce dreissenid populations within unionid restoration structures and within unionid beds. Assess implementation of potential integrated pest management strategies that incorporate the \n<em>Pf<\/em>-CL145A-based product as an aid in native unionid restoration.\n<br /> \n<br /> Zebra and quagga mussels are an imminent threat to unionid survival in and around the Great Lakes. Some natural resource managers consider existing dreissenid mussel populations to be the greatest threat to unionid populations, many of which are listed as threatened or endangered. Recent evidence indicates that dreissenid mussels are not only a threat to native mussels but they are disrupting the entire Great Lakes ecosystem ? from the microscopic organisms at the bottom of the food web all the way up to the most desirable game fish such as coho, lake trout and whitefish. Since there are currently no safe and effective ways to manage dreissenids in unionid beds, restoration efforts have focused on removing attached dreissenids from unionid shells, relocation, and propagation. Propagation cages holding thousands of juvenile unionids, can become encrusted with dreissenids and reduce water circulation (and food for unionids) within the structure, and dreissenid mussels can attach to the juvenile unionids themselves. Lake Pepin (Pool 4 of the Mississippi River) provides an excellent example of the impact of zebra mussels on unionid mussel propagation ? unionid propagation in Lake Pepin was extremely successful prior to zebra mussel infestation but was discontinued due to the intense fouling of cages and native juvenile mussels after zebra mussel populations exploded in Lake Pepin.In close coordination with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR), the Wisconsin DNR, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and others, pilot field trials will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the \n<em>Pf<\/em>-CL145A product to control zebra mussels attached to native unionids or mussel propagation cage materials. The pilot studies will be completed in the UMESC mobile assay trailer, a self-contained mobile laboratory. Water from a local water body will be pumped through test vessels enclosed in the mobile laboratory where zebra mussels, attached to mussel propagation cage material and to native unionids, will be exposed under controlled conditions to the \n<em>Pf<\/em>-CL145A product. Test water containing the \n<em>Pf<\/em>-CL145A product will be disposed of according to procedures established by EPA or the state regulatory agency. Five test sites will be selected from Minnesota and Wisconsin lakes and rivers that have established zebra mussel populations in consultation with the respective state DNR. Mussel propagation cage material will be artificially ?seeded? with zebra mussels in the fall of 2011. Pilot field trials will be completed in summer 2012 after non-target studies have been completed. Data from the non-target studies will be summarized and provided to the respective state DNR prior to conducting pilot field efficacy studies. If the pilot trials are successful, studies in 2013 will focus on in-water applications to unionid mussel beds or propagation cages.\n<br /> \n<br /> In close coordination with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR), the Wisconsin DNR, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and others, pilot field trials will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the \n<em>Pf<\/em>-CL145A product to control zebra mussels attached to native unionids or mussel propagation cage materials.

Results of this project will also be used to establish methods that can be used in inter-laboratory (ring) testing of sediments with mussels by multiple laboratories.  This project is intended to result in methods that will assist EPA, States and Tribes with the assessment of  contaminated sediments and a determination of their effects on freshwater mussels.",

This pilot project will develop approaches that will restore coastal wetland function and increase ecosystem resilience to be used as a model throughout the Great Lakes basin. USGS will focus on restoring natural hydrologic processes in diked coastal wetlands adjacent to Great Lakes waters to improve wetland functions like phosphorus retention and restoration of habitats for fish and wildlife. Sustainable approaches are being developed in the Maumee River Area of Concern (AOC) to restore the hydrology and other processes that drive coastal wetland functions and increase ecosystem resiliency. Results will be evaluated within an adaptive management framework and integrated with similar sites in the Saginaw River/Bay AOC and throughout the Great Lakes basin. Since the connection to the wetland was restored, the abundance and diversity of fish using the wetland habitats has exploded. Northern pike and other recreationally and commercially valued species are again using the 40 ha wetland for reproduction and feeding. Bird usage by waterfowl and several listed species is extensive. Preliminary water-quality data indicate that the water exiting the wetland back into the Maumee River AOC had significantly less phosphorus and other nutrients than the incoming water, which has very positive implications for the water quality BUI for the Maumee River AOC. Additional samples taken through FY 2013 will characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of fish use, nutrient retention, and other important wetland processes. Coordinated efforts with the coastal wetland monitoring program, data collection efforts identified in Remedial Action Plans, NOAA-funded habitat restoration projects, and The Nature Conservancy to help guide regional restoration strategies and maximize basin-wide impact of locally-important projects.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Relevance/Benefits<\/h4> The reconnected wetland continues to be a sink for phosphorus, nitrogen, and sediment from Crane Creek. High levels of sediment and nutrient retention (~50%) have been observed during the passage of storm or flood events that move large quantities of water into the wetland. These data show the potential water quality improvements associated with this type of wetland restoration and provide baseline data that can be used to promote further restoration efforts in the Maumee AOC and other Great Lakes coastal areas.\n<br /> \n<br /> The results of this study have led to further wetland reconnection projects throughout the Great Lakes basin. Numerous GLRI projects have included water-control or fish-passage structures as a direct result of our work, and the ongoing monitoring at ONWR has helped shape wetland management decisions regionally. Although focused on the Crane Creek coastal wetland complex from 2010-2012, the results of this work are influencing regional management and restoration decisions and supporting expanded landscape-level analyses in 2013.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Key Findings<\/h4> Fish diversity and abundance in the restored wetland has increased dramatically in the two years since reconnection. The wetland has been acting as a nursery and breeding grounds for many species including: northern pike (Esox lucius), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), white and black crappies (Pomoxis spp.), and numerous species of sunfish (Lepomis spp.). High resolution sonar data have shown that fish access the wetland at all times of the day from late winter to late autumn. Data on fish species richness and abundance changes could be used to identify progress toward delisting of the ?Degraded Fish and Wildlife Population? BUI in Maumee River AOC. Discussions with Ohio EPA and Partners for Clean Streams are helping guide analysis of existing data and data collection strategies in 2013.\n<br /> \n<br /> Invasive common carp were effectively excluded from the restored wetland habitat during their destructive spawning stages through the use of specially designed gates in the water control structure. By using an established bar width and excluding mature breeding size carp, integrated pest management approaches were applied to limit the risk of damage by invasive carp while still allowing northern pike and other native fish to pass into the wetlands. Similar technologies are being included in many other GLRI-funded coastal wetland restoration projects in western Lake Erie and Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron.\n<br /> \n<br /> Waterfowl and piscivorous bird usage of the wetland increased after being reconnected to Lake Erie. The availability of wetland habitat was crucial in 2012 when low water levels stranded some coastal wetlands and drought conditions contributed to dry conditions in many diked wetlands in the area. However, the reconnected wetland held water throughout the summer and was used extensively by migrating waterfowl in the autumn.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Products<\/h4> A \n<strong>model<\/strong>&nbsp;was developed to estimate total phosphorus and total sediment loads to the reconnected wetland using high frequency turbidity and discharge measurements. This allows for more accurate estimates of nutrient and sediment retention in the wetland and can serve as a foundation for the development of similar models applicable at larger scales.\n<br /> &nbsp;",
        "purpose": "The purposes of the project are to: 1) hydrologically reconnect a diked wetland to Lake Erie to restore coastal wetland function and native species habitats; 2) implement a short- and long-term monitoring program to characterize response of biotic and abiotic ecosystem elements, especially those relating to Beneficial Use Impairments (e.g., phosphorus retention) after restoration actions, and 3) communicate project results to researchers, managers, policy makers, and the general public to ensure that outcomes of the project can: a) guide future management and restoration efforts in western Lake Erie and throughout the Great Lakes basin; b)  contribute to landscape-level efforts to improve ecosystem resiliency to stressors, and c) support implementation of sustainable and adaptive management strategies.",

        "body": "<h4>Description of Work<\/h4> Researchers at the USGS Lake Erie Biological Station will be using three different gears to try to capture eggs and larvae of grass carp. Bongo nets, so named because when held up they resemble Bongo drums, are fine-mesh, cone-shaped nets that are towed through the water for 5-10 minutes. These nets capture floating eggs (grass carp eggs float) and any small fish that can?t swim fast enough to get out of the way. Light traps are fished at night and capture fish that are attracted to light ? like grass carp. Light traps are fished for about 1 hour at a time in backwater areas where small fish seek cover from current and predators and abundant food. Dipnets are small, fine-mesh nets that a researcher can use to sample areas that can?t be sampled as easily with Bongo nets or light traps. Each of these gears will be used at least once a week June through September. These gears will also be used for three consecutive days during one or more high-flow events. Grass carp prefer to spawn when water flow is high, because high flows provide the best conditions for eggs to remain suspended to complete development.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Relevance/Benefits<\/h4> There are at least two direct benefits of this research. First, if we capture eggs or larvae of Grass Carp we will demonstrate absolutely that Grass Carp are reproducing successfully in the Sandusky River. Second, using methods to estimate the age, in days, of larvae and the developmental stage of eggs we can determine when, within approximately an hour, and where, within a few hundred meters, Grass Carp spawned. With this information, and knowledge of river conditions when spawning occurred, we can begin to devise methods to prevent or disrupt spawning.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Key Findings<\/h4> \n<ul> \n <li>As of June 2014 we have identified sampling locations and have tested gear on the Sandusky River.<\/li> \n <li>The first high-flow event was in early June, and researchers were able to sample three consecutive days during that event.<\/li> \n<\/ul> &nbsp; \n<h4>Products<\/h4> This project began in June 2014 and no products are available. We anticipate several reports, presentations, and peer-reviewed articles from this work that will inform future management decisions and actions.\n<br /> &nbsp;",
        "purpose": "In October 2012 a commercial fisherman in Ohio caught several small grass carp. These fish were all approximately the same length, which led researchers to think they might have been naturally reproduced. An examination of otoliths, small bones in fish heads that help them maintain equilibrium, revealed high levels of the naturally-occurring chemical strontium. This chemical has a particularly high concentration in the Sandusky and Maumee, rivers, leading researchers to believe the small grass carp were probably born there. This provided the first indirect evidence of grass carp reproduction in the Great Lakes, but direct evidence is still lacking. This project is designed to ?catch them in the act? of spawning.",

Various rivers have been modeled, with the determination that under some flow conditions much shorter rivers than previously believed would be adequate for Asian carp reproduction.

        "purpose": "Developmental rate of the eggs and larvae is a key parameter to be incorporated in models that determine where Asian carps are capable of spawning, and also, when coupled with field collections of drifting eggs and larvae, can be used to determine spawning locations or where the larvae will leave the drift and move to nursery locations. These locations are required to inform control efforts based on spawning disruption or destruction of the carp in their nurseries. Previous published work had closely described the developmental stages, but had poor temperature control and thus was inadequate for this work. Also, because substantial genetic change has occurred since the introduction of Asian carps to North America, it was important that this work be done with North American fish for maximum reliability of the models.",

These loads will be supplied to the Cadmus Group, Inc. to help calibrate SWAT models for the Basin. A detailed water budget will be developed for the Pool Lakes by measuring all major inflow and outflow sources and estimating the magnitude of minor sources. A detailed phosphorus budget will be obtained by quantifying the phosphorus loading associated with each water inflow and outflow source. Loading at each stream monitoring site will be estimated using a rating curve method or GCLAS with streamflow monitored by the USGS and water quality data collected by the Wisconsin DNR. Loading from ungaged areas will be obtained from the SWAT modeling being performed in the basin as part of separate studies by Cadmus Group, Inc. Current water quality (trophic state) of each of the four lakes in the Winnebago Pool will be obtained from the Wisconsin DNR and evaluated relative to long-term trends. The water-quality information will compared to that estimated for the lakes based on the phosphorus loading through the use of selected models in BATHTUB (Walker, 1996). BATHTUB will then be used to simulate the likely response of each of the Pool Lakes to phosphorus loading changes associated with various lake-management actions that might be implemented and specific climate scenarios. Output from the lake to the Lower Fox River will be estimated from data collected by the Wisconsin DNR at Neenah and Menasha and using output from the BATHTUB model. This information will be supplied (as a Final Report/Journal Article) to those developing the TMDL for the Upper Fox River Basin and those modeling the watershed downstream of Lake Winnebago.\n<br /> &nbsp;",
        "purpose": "The purpose of the project is to: 1. Document the present and historical water quality of each of the Winnebago Pool Lakes (Poygan, Winneconne, Butte des Morts, and Winnebago); 2.Estimate total annual phosphorus and total suspended sediment loads at various monitored locations throughout the Upper Fox and Wolf River Watershed; 3. Determine a detailed phosphorus budget for each of the Pool Lakes that quantifies the sources of phosphorus to each lake;  4. Use calibrated eutrophication models to simulate the likely response in phosphorus, chlorophyll a, and Secchi depth of each of the Winnebago Pool Lakes to changes in phosphorus loading associated with various lake-management actions that might be implemented to improve water quality, and understand how these actions may affect the nutrient loading to the Lower Fox River and Green Bay; 5. Provide information (Final Report) to construct a TMDL for the Upper Fox/Wolf River Watershed and the Winnebago Pool Lakes, and provide information for updating the Lower Fox and Green Bay TMDL. ",

The areas with fractures were further investigated by collecting sediment, geologic, and hydraulic data that could indicate a connection between the surface-water bodies and the groundwater. Water-level and water-quality were collected from wells, the Des Plaines River, and the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal for several months to determine how the water moved through the area over a range of hydraulic conditions.

Areas of Concern (AOC) principles and guidelines were developed as an initial reference point from which appropriate restoration criteria could be developed. Stage 2 Remedial Action Plans (RAPs) were developed for each of these AOCs to address impairments to any one of 14 beneficial uses associated with these areas. Specific remediation actions are completed in order to restore the beneficial use. When monitoring data shows a beneficial use is no longer impaired, the state and EPA can remove that BUI. When data shows all identified beneficial use impairments have been eliminated, the EPA can submit a proposal to the International Joint Commission (IJC) for removing the designation of AOC in its entirety. Specific information and measureable indicators are needed in order to demonstrate restoration of the beneficial use. The USGS will meet with State partners, and others, to develop a scientific framework to support decision needs specific to the AOCs, and when possible across multiple AOCs. This may include: determining appropriate measureable indicators, compilation of existing data and information, defining reference conditions, development of decision support framework, discussion of monitoring needed, etc. The Beneficial Use Impairments (BUIs) where USGS will be most likely to be of help are: fish consumption advisories, fish tumor presence, eutrophication and unwanted algae, drinking water problems, beach health, and concentrations of PCBs in lake trout and walleyes. The other area that we can and are providing support is in assessing new toxic threats.\n<br /> &nbsp;",

Yet, the LaMP process is lacking a holistic framework that allows these individual actions to be planned and understood within the broader context of the Great Lakes ecosystem. To help this issue, a conceptual framework for Lake Michigan Coastal/Nearshore Ecosystems was developed to address for major LaMP goals; Can we drink the water?, Can we eat the fish?, Can we swim in the water?, Are all habitats healthy, naturally diverse, and sufficient to sustain viable biological communities?",

        "body": "<h4>Description of Work<\/h4> The Great Lakes ecosystem has undergone major changes over the last two decades related to the invasion of Dreissenid mussels, increased water clarity, increased benthic algae and associated water quality problems. For reasons not yet entirely understood, and that have bi-national significance, water column total phosphorus has not significantly increased over the last decade but the relative percent of the more biologically available dissolved phosphorus has increased. The filtering action of Dreissenid mussels has been shown to increase concentrations of dissolved phosphorus in the water column immediately above mussel beds and this had been hypothesized as one explanation for the increase of benthic algae. However, the Lake Ontario 2008 CSMI monitoring year?s assessment of nearshore water eutrophication problems concluded that localized eutrophication problems could not be explained by the presence of mussel beds alone. Tributary nutrient inputs always appeared to be a common factor related to localized nearshore problems. This work will expand the nearshore work begun in 2008, as part of a binational assessment coordinated by the Lake Ontario Lakewide Management Plan, to develop better understand the connection between tributary nutrient inputs and Lake Ontario nearshore water quality and nutrient fate and transport with the aim of identifying potential management actions. This nearshore work will complement offshore work to be coordinated by US and Canadian Lake Ontario Lakewide Management Plan partners through the use of the research vessels Lake Guardian and Limnos. The maintenance of flow gaging systems and regular monitoring programs are essential to understand nutrient loadings and impacts. This work will allow the maintenance of gaging stations and the collection of nutrient samples from six major, and several selected minor New York Lake Ontario tributaries through the 2014 field year. Included will be the GLRI priority watershed, the Genesee River, and Oak Orchard Creek, both identified as large nutrient loading basins to the southern shore of Lake Ontario. In addition to seven regularly scheduled sampling events for each tributary, the sampling plan will be designed to capture spring, growing season and extreme flow events with a focus on understanding particulate and dissolved nutrient concentrations and loadings. This work will be in addition to the work being conducted for template 76 at the Genesee River. This information will be of tremendous value in supporting the development of nutrient loading estimates and for the development of nutrient fate and transport models coincident with the new bi-national Great Lakes Water Quality agreement protocol. Studies of water quality and the lower foodweb at selected nearshore zones impacted by tributary inputs will be designed to better understand the fate and transport of nutrients in the water column and aquatic foodweb and the connection with the health of near-shore aquatic communities and local beaches along the Lake Ontario shoreline. Timing of nearshore sampling events will be coordinated with tributary monitoring. Both tributary and nearshore monitoring and research activities will place an emphasis on developing a better understanding of dissolved and total phosphorus ratios and whether different ratios drive varying biological responses. All of this work will be coordinated with a range of US and Canadian Lake Ontario nutrient related work being conducted in 2013 in order to develop a basin-wide assessment of nutrient loadings, fate and transport and the identification of potential management strategies and research in support of the Lake Ontario Lakewide Management Plan (LaMP). A review of currently on-going, and soon-to-be completed, nutrient-related studies, including fate and transport and the response of biological systems, will be included as part of initial planning workshops and factored into the final near-shore project design.\n<br /> \n<br /> Additionally, the Niagara River connecting channel will be monitored starting August 2014 for one year, as a pilot study. Samples will be collected in the channel at Ft. Erie (upstream) and near Niagara-on-the-Lake (downstream) of the connecting channel. A variety of constituents including: nutrients, toxics, emerging contaminants, legacy contaminants, and health-care products, along with flow data will be collected seasonally 3 times a year and 3 times during the summer months based on lake temperature, to capture bioaccumulation effects on these constituents, especially nutrient concentrations.\n<br /> &nbsp;",
        "purpose": "High quality water quality nutrient information is collected from major New York Lake Ontario tributaries. In addition to regularly scheduled events, monitoring effectively captures Spring, growing season and high flow events that are critical to developing a more complete understanding of seasonal patterns of nutrient loadings and any seasonal changes in the relative amounts of total and dissolved nutrients. This will allow comparison of 5-year average annual loading rates of both sediment and nutrients that will address targeted watersheds such as the Genesee River and its embayment. Studies of Lake Ontario tributary impacts on near-shore water quality provide insights on how near-shore waters respond to tributary nutrient inputs, identify water quality, and biological impairments and develop an improved understanding of nutrient fate and transport in the near-shore zone and the aquatic food web. Studies also provide insights on monitoring approaches best suited to characterize nutrient related water quality problems. Existing nutrient loading models are updated to provide improved nutrient loading estimates.",

        "purpose": "Water recreation and associated tourism add billions of dollars to the economy of the Great Lakes Region and provide numerous societal benefits.  There are several problems, however, with the current approach to establishing beach closures and advisories.  First, current beach monitoring practices rely on methods for culturing fecal-indicator bacteria that take 18-24 hours for results, too long to provide information on current water-quality conditions.  Secondly, sources of fecal contamination in recreational waters are often unknown and/or of nonpoint origins.  The relations between coastal processes (sediment transport and storage, ground-water/surface-water interactions, wave actions, seiches, etc.) and bacteria concentrations have not been comprehensively studied in the Great Lakes. Development of methods that discriminate between human and animal nonpoint-source fecal contamination are needed to help identify risks associated with contaminated recreational waters.  Finally, recreational waters are seldom monitored for pathogens, which often have different transport and survival properties than the fecal-indicator bacteria used to indicate their presence.",

        "body": "<h4>Description of Work<\/h4> A number of field studies have shown that mayflies (Ephemeroptera) tend to be more sensitive than other benthic macroinvertebrate taxa to elevated levels of total dissolved solids in streams impacted by mining. Until relatively recently, difficulties with culturing have precluded the use of mayflies as laboratory toxicity testing organisms; however, researchers at Stroud Water Research Center have found parthenogenic species that readily reproduce under laboratory conditions, and researchers at the US EPA EERD laboratory have developed laboratory cultured diets for mayflies that will help to move toward standardization of methods. Recent efforts at the Illinois Natural History Survey built upon these efforts and developed a method for conducting full life-cycle toxicity tests with the mayfly Centroptilum triangulifer using a modification of the EERD laboratory cultured diet. Endpoints for the full life-cycle test included survival to pre-emergent nymph (PEN) stage, number of days to PEN stage, percent emergence, pre-egg-laying live weight, and number of eggs produced. Initial tests were conducted with sodium salts of chloride, sulfate, and nitrate. In acute (96-h) exposures, LC50s for C. triangulifer were approximately one half to two thirds of those generated in our laboratory with Ceriodaphnia dubia. In the full life-cycle chloride test, the most sensitive endpoints were survival to PEN stage, and mean number of days to PEN stage, with a maximum allowable toxicant concentration (MATC) of 267 mg Cl-/L. The fact that major ion toxicity to standard laboratory test organisms like cladocerans, amphipods, and fish, are dependent on the ionic composition of water or an effluent has been well established. Researchers at the US EPA laboratory in Duluth, MN, previously developed statistical models to predict toxicity of high TDS waters to standard test organisms based on ionic composition, and current efforts in that laboratory are aimed at improving the model. It is known that for crustaceans and fish, solutions tend to be more toxic when dominated by particular major ions (i.e., K+, Mg+, HCO3-), and toxicity due to several individual ions, including SO42-, is reduced when solutions contain more than one cation. However, essentially nothing is known about how ionic composition influences responses of C. triangulifer to elevated major ions. Because this mayfly appears to be more sensitive to elevated major ions than other laboratory cultured test organisms, studies with this organism that could contribute to the development of the new ion toxicity model are required.\n<br /> &nbsp;",
        "purpose": "The goals of this research will include: 1) conducting acute toxicity tests with C. triangulifer to determine how changes in ionic composition impact responses to elevated major ions. Specific interactions will include but not be limited to calcium/chloride and calcium/sulfate, and sodium/potassium; 2) conducting chronic toxicity tests with C. triangulifer to determine if trends observed in acute tests are observed in full life-cycle exposures; 3) continuing previous efforts to conduct acute tests other wild mayfly species to predict chronic effects; and 4) assisting one or more other laboratories in becoming competent with the newly developed full life-cycle test with C. triangulifer with the goal of validating and standardizing the method.",

        "body": "<h4>Description of Work<\/h4> Jeorse Park Beach is located in East Chicago, Indiana, within the Grand Calumet River Area of Concern (AOC), which has been identified as having all 14 beneficial use designations impaired, including beach closings. Jeorse Park Beach has been identified as one of the most highly contaminated beaches in the nation, with annual beach closings due to bacterial contamination as high as 76% in 2010. Further, beach closings have steadily increased each year since beach monitoring was initiated in 2005 in response to the Beaches Environmental and Coastal Health (BEACH) Act. Beach closings represent an environmental, social, and economic burden, the alleviation of which require various remediation strategies targeted to specific sources of microbiological contamination. Research by USGS at Jeorse Park Beach in cooperation with the State of Indiana has identified dual factors contributing to beach closings: (1) the enclosed circulation of the beach area prevents contaminants from moving out of the embayment and (2) resident shore birds (geese, gulls) are a significant source of fecal contamination to the swimming water. In addition to bird contamination, evidence of human sewage contamination has also been found at this beach. The presence of additional sources of contamination, originating within or outside of the beach, and the influence of beach circulation patterns on retaining and influencing the persistence of these bacteria remain unknown.\n<br /> &nbsp;",
        "purpose": "In this study, we propose to investigate the processes by which contamination is carried to the beach and retained.  Work conducted in Phase I indicated potential sources of contamination, but an understanding of currents and their influence on contaminant advection and distribution is needed to determine restoration strategies and potential for success.We propose to investigate the sources of high concentrations of indicator bacteria at Jeorse Park Beach and the relative influence of these potentially varied sources on beach water quality.  If these rivers are releasing high concentrations of bacteria into the lake, there is a potential for nearshore currents to carry these contaminants to the Jeorse Park Beach, where they may become trapped in by embayment circulation patterns in the nearshore.  With the results of this project, beach managers will have the necessary tools to pursue remediation of contaminants and therefore reduce the number of beach closings.  Because of the frequency of the problem, results of this project could be transferred to benefit hundreds of beaches throughout the Great Lakes and coastal waters nationally.  Benefits of a reduction in beach closures include decreased human health risk, increased recreational access, and the promotion of economic opportunities.",

        "body": "<h4>Description of Work<\/h4> Studies assessing seasonal and spatial changes in digestive enzymes and gill raker morphology in bigheaded carps and native planktivorous fishes have been completed. Results indicate that bigheaded carps feed earlier in the year than native filter-feeding fishes and that certain digestive enzymes present in bigheaded carps are either not present in some native fishes or are much less active in the native species than in bigheaded carps. Results also indicate that the gill raker morphology of bigheaded carps is relatively constant with minimal seasonally or spatially relevant changes unlike that of the native gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) which had both seasonal and spatially correlated changes in gill raker morphology. These data are currently being used to inform the development of microparticle formulations to target control agent uptake by and release in bigheaded carps.\n<br /> \n<br /> Studies are in progress to assess control agent availability/uptake from microparticles by bigheaded carps and native fishes. Work is also proceeding to determine the buoyancy of microparticles (i.e., do they sink, suspend or float when placed in water) and whether the control agent leaches from the microparticle. Studies are also in progress to assess the palatability of microparticle formulations to bigheaded carps (i.e., will bigheaded carps consume the microparticles). Only those microparticle formulations with minimal to no leaching, that are neutral to positively buoyant and are readily accepted by both bighead carp and silver carp will be used in further studies. Several microparticle formulations met these acceptance criteria and initial controlled, laboratory trials are in progress in the specially designed Invasive Species Complex at the USGS Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center, La Crosse, WI. In these trials, bigheaded carps and native fish are being offered microparticle formulations containing an EPA-registered piscicide. As the trials proceed, microparticle formulations will be modified as needed to enhance acceptance of the control agent-laden microparticles by bigheaded carps and minimize their uptake by native fish.\n<br /> \n<br /> Development of these control agent-laden microparticles is a complex process that will include assessments of the risk of non-target animal exposure (e.g., native fishes and aquatic invertebrates, terrestrial animals that might consume fish that have consumed the microparticles, etc.,), degradation characteristics of the microparticles (i.e., how long will the microparticle and control agent persist), and other data needed to obtain registration of these control agent and microparticle formulations. Using an EPA-registered control agent for microparticle formulations is a benefit because data already exist for the control agent registration ?data development will focus on how incorporating the control agent within the microparticle changes risks associated with exposure to that control agent.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Relevance/Benefits<\/h4> Developing a control agent-laden microparticle could provide natural resource managers with the potential to target control efforts of bigheaded carps within selected habitats while minimizing the impacts to native species. Applied in conjunction with the feeding stimulants being developed by USGS scientists, managers could target delivery of control agent-laden microparticle within locations where bigheaded carp congregate to feed, minimizing the area where the microparticles are applied and limiting potential effects on native species. Applied within an integrated pest management framework, the development of these control agent-laden microparticles could substantially enhance the tools available to managers to control or limit populations of bigheaded carps. Although initial formulations focus on incorporating lethal chemical control agents, future formulations could incorporate biological or chemical agents which may have lethal to non-lethal effects.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Key Findings<\/h4> \n<ul> \n <li>The size of the pores in silver carp gill rakers varied with fish size but not spatially or temporally whereas gill raker spacing in gizzard shad suggested phenotypic plasticity as the spacing varied seasonally and spatially.<\/li> \n <li>Bigheaded carps offered a range of sizes of microparticles containing a non-toxic dye readily consumed the microparticles and appeared to prefer microparticles ranging in size from 50 to 100 &micro;m.<\/li> \n <li>Targeting a microparticle size range of 50 to 100 &micro;m limits the number of non-target fish species that retain this particle size as food but there is overlap with some common species (e.g. gizzard shad).<\/li> \n <li>Bigheaded carps continue to feed at water temperatures below those at which native filter-feeding fish feed.<\/li> \n <li>Bigheaded carps have similar feed capacities when held at 12 or 24&deg;C, but have the greatest capacity at 18&deg;C<\/li> \n <li>The gastric evacuation rate of bigheaded carps is temperature dependent and slower at 12&deg;C than at 24&deg;C.<\/li> \n <li>Trypsin and phosphatases (digestive enzymes) are present in greater quantities and are more active in bigheaded carps than in native filter-feeding fishes.<\/li> \n<\/ul>",
        "purpose": "Current control agents registered for use to control invasive or nuisance fish by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are not selective, and when applied throughout the entire water column, expose native fishes to lethal levels of the control agent. Development of a microparticle delivery system filter-feeding bigheaded carps (bighead carp Hypophthalmichthys nobilis and silver carp H. molitrix) consume could reduce impacts to non-target native species by limiting their exposure to the control agents. Using technologies developed for aquaculture, pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries, USGS is developing and evaluating different microparticle formulations to identify those that may deliver biological or chemical control agents to control populations of bigheaded carps. Selecting the right formulation will require an in-depth understanding of the feeding habits, anatomical features that filter-feeding animals use to retain food particles (e.g. gill raker morphology), digestive physiology, and xenobiotic metabolism of native species and the bigheaded carps.",

        "body": "<h4>Description of Work<\/h4> The sensitivity of listed species of fish or amphibians was evaluated in acute and chronic toxicity tests conducted with a range of inorganic or organic chemicals with different toxic modes of action. Results of these studies indicate that the acute or chronic sensitivity of rainbow trout, but not fathead minnow, frequently provided protective acute or chronic toxicity thresholds for most of the listed species evaluated. However, only a limited number of species of sculpins or darters were included in this evaluation, and not all species tested occurred in the Great Lakes watershed. The objective of the proposed study will be to: (1) provide additional chronic toxicity data for sculpins or darters indigenous to the Great Lakes to complement the limited chronic toxicity data for pentachlorophenol (PCP) or copper previously reported for darters or for sculpins and (2) provide acute toxicity data for additional chemicals of concern with sculpins, darters, rainbow trout, and fathead minnow. USGS-Columbia will conduct: (1) acute 4-d and chronic 28-d toxicity tests with PCP and mottled sculpins, (2) acute 4-d and chronic 28-d toxicity tests with copper and PCP with fathead minnows (repeating the Besser et al. 2005 study). If additional funding is provided in FY14, USGS Columbia will conduct acute 4-d and chronic 28-d toxicity tests with copper and PCP with an additional darter species of concern in the Great Lakes. The combined results of the previous and new studies would include 4-d acute and 28-d chronic toxicity data sets for PCP and copper for the following species: rainbow trout, fathead minnow (2X), mottled sculpin, fountain darter, and one additional species of darter from the Great Lakes watershed. Acute toxicity tests will also be conducted with up to about six additional chemicals of concern with sculpins, darters, rainbow trout, and fathead minnows. The number of chemicals tested and the number of species of sculpins or darters tested will be dependent on the availability of early life stages of sculpins or darters. Other taxa might be considered if newly hatched young of the desired species of sculpin or darters cannot be obtained. Selection of the species to be tested will be decided based on a review of the literature and on consultations with USEPA Region 5.\n<br /> &nbsp;",
        "purpose": "Results of this study will determine the acute or chronic sensitivity of sculpins or darters (warm water species) compared to the commonly tested species of rainbow trout (a cold-water species) or fathead minnow (a warm-water species).",

        "body": "<h4>Description of Work<\/h4> This work began by assembling fish toxicant data into a common database and examining the database for trends in toxicant data. The trends found in the toxicant database were linked to physiochemical properties of the individual toxicants. Combining the toxicant trends with the physiochemical properties may allow for the prediction of toxicity and the identification of chemicals with selectivity for the Asian carp. Identifying a selective toxicant may provide control of Asian carps while minimizing effects on other non-target aquatic species. When Asian carp specific toxicants are identified from the initial screen within the database these toxicants are then further screened in toxicity assays using fish cell lines developed in an earlier phase of this project. The use of fish cell lines as an initial screening tool provides a rapid and inexpensive method of assessment. It also minimizes the number of fish required for laboratory experiments during the development of new toxicants. The toxicants which have the best selectivity for Asian carp, as determined by fish cell line response, will complete additional screenings and evaluation to determine if they are viable candidates for registration as a new fish toxicant.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Relevance/Benefits<\/h4> The benefits of using fish cell lines as a screening paradigm for selecting new candidate toxicants is three-fold. First, time is saved due to the fact that no fish broods are required to reach an age/weight needed to test chemical in a laboratory tank test system. Screening dozens or even a few hundred potential toxicants would take extensive time to cultivate the number of fish required from multiple species. Furthermore, the tests themselves generally require up to a week to complete and are therefore labor intensive. Although screening of toxicants with live fish will still be necessary, the initial and secondary screens with the toxicant database and the fish cell lines will minimize the number of live fish tests required. Second, fish cell lines are much cheaper to maintain than live fish. No large quantities of water are required with the incorporated cost of preparing, holding, and discharging the used water contaminated with the toxicant tested. The cost of maintaining the fish cell lines is also well below the cost of cultivating tanks of numerous fish species. Also, toxicants that are tested can be expensive and using fish cell lines will minimize the costs associated with the testing of expensive chemicals. Furthermore, fish cell lines are immediately available to test any range of chemicals on multiple fish species. Finally, minimizing the total number of animals used in any test program is ethically preferred and even mandated in many European countries.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Key Findings<\/h4> The links between the physiochemical properties and toxicant trends have been developed and are ready to apply to chemical databases to identify potential fish species-specific toxicants.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Products<\/h4> Bighead and silver carp gill, skin, and fry cell lines\n<br /> \n<br /> Database of physiochemical properties and toxic effect of specific toxicants on invasive and indigenous fish species to be made available in Spring 2014.\n<br /> &nbsp;",
        "purpose": "Currently, the identification of potential species-selective toxicants is based on the conduct of numerous acute toxicity tests which is labor intensive, slow and requires the exposure of numerous live fish from multiple species to each potential toxicant. Species-selective toxicants are preferable to non-selective toxicants because they can be used to target nuisance species like Asian carp while not harming other species. There are chemical databases (e.g., U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ECOTOX database) available that can be used to identify toxicants that are potential fish management chemicals. However, existing databases do not have the capacity to identify chemicals present in the database that have potential as selective toxicants. This project focuses on improving the processes used to identify potential candidate toxicants with comparable or possibly greater selectivity than current registered fish toxicants.",

        "body": "<h4>Description of Work<\/h4> Several techniques will be used to characterize these potential controlling factors and data collection will be coordinated with the other agencies efforts to provide maximum complementary data collection and analysis. Flow, velocity and a suite of water-quality parameters (water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, specific conductance, chlorophyll-a, blue-green algae, nitrate and turbidity) will be collected in the main channel and backwater areas of the river. Plankton sampling data from the Illinois Department of Natural History will be used to characterize the available food supply in this reach of the river. Day-to-day movement of Asian carp recorded from field observations and telemetered fish (IDNR/USFWS/USACE/Southern Illinois University (SIU)) will be analyzed with the flow and water-quality data to evaluate fish response to changing flow conditions. Existing data, including long-term water-quality sampling by the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District (MWRD) of Greater Chicago will be reviewed. In addition to a greater understanding of why Asian carp have not moved further upstream, the velocity and flow data will be evaluated to determine optimum locations (channel constrictions, pinch points, backwater areas, etc.) within the river that may be suitable for the testing of Asian carp control strategies. The applicability of this methodology will be evaluated for the downstream sections of the Illinois River.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Relevance/Benefits<\/h4> Greater understanding of Asian carps preferred habitat with regards to hydraulic and water-quality characteristics and insight into how habitat may be altered to deter them from spreading into new areas.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Key Findings<\/h4> Findings will be reported as the project progresses.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Products<\/h4> The hydraulic and water-quality data collected in the Illinois River&nbsp; \n<a href=\"http://waterdata.usgs.gov/usa/nwis/uv?411959088280101\">backwater near Morris, Illinois<\/a>&nbsp;and in the&nbsp; \n<a href=\"http://waterdata.usgs.gov/usa/nwis/uv?05543010\">main channel at Seneca, Illinois<\/a>&nbsp;are available in real-time.\n<br /> &nbsp;",
        "purpose": "The upstream movement of Asian carp through the Illinois River has been observed and recorded by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). These efforts have documented the distribution of the Asian carp population within the pools of the Illinois River and have identified habitats favorable for Asian carp. Since 2006, the upstream expansion of the carp population has stalled in the Marseilles and Dresden Island Pools. Sharp contrasts in habitat, flow conditions, water quality, and food supply between these pools and the Chicago Area Waterway System may be acting as controlling factors to the stalled movement. In addition to the Illinois River, other rivers, such as the Wabash River in Indiana and reservoir tributaries in Missouri, provide an opportunity to examine factors that influence Asian carp movement, spawning, and recruitment. These rivers represent the lower end of the size range thought to be used by Asian carps for spawning. A major objective of this project is to determine the controlling factor(s), with the possibility that one or more of these factor(s) could be used to prevent future expansion into additional rivers or to reduce Asian carp populations.",

The first hypothesis is that bed sediments at selected sample locations in the AOC (in three tributaries and in the St. Lawrence River) are no more toxic to the test species than bed sediments collected from control sites located outside (generally upstream from) the AOC. Acute (survival) and chronic (growth) whole bed-sediment toxicity tests will be conducted using the midge (Chironomus dilutus), following standard methods (USEPA 1994; USEPA 2000). The second hypothesis is that the benthic macroinvertebrate communities from targeted sites within the AOC are not significantly different, or are affected (impacted) no more seriously than the communities encountered at reference (control) sites located outside the AOC according to spatial patterns in benthic community composition (nonparametric ordination) and the Biological Assessment Profile (BAP) index and component metrics for Ponar samples collected from soft bed sediments (fig. 1) developed by NY State Department of Environmental Conservation (Bode et al. 2002; Smith et al. 2009). The component metrics of the BAP include: SPP (species richness), HBI (Hilsenhoff Biotic Index), DOM3 (Dominance-3), PMA (Percent Model Affinity), and DIV (species diversity). The mean score of the five indices denotes the overall BAP and associated impact for each site. Although several bed sediment-collection methods are suitable, the Petite Ponar sampler will be used to collect 5 replicate macroinvertebrate-community samples and a single composite sample for bed sediment toxicity tests at each study site. Bed-sediment sizes will be characterized by either the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Sediment Laboratory or NYSDEC subcontract laboratory using a subsample (split) obtained from the composite bed sediment-toxicity sample. Statistical analyses and multivariate (ordination) methods will be used to test the two hypotheses and to determine if the bed sediments within the St. Lawrence River at Massena AOC meet either criterion for delisting the benthos BUI.\n<br /> &nbsp;",
        "purpose": "The objective of this study is to determine if the benthos beneficial use is, or is not impaired in parts of the St. Lawrence River at Massena AOC. Benthic macroinvertebrate community data and bed sediment-toxicity test results will be used specifically to test whether bed sediments in the St. Lawrence River at Massena AOC meet established criteria for delisting the benthos BUI.",

USGS is working with the Great Lakes Observing System collaboration and other data sharing efforts across the Great Lakes to compile the data into a user friendly format that is accessible on line. Elevation data will be expanded in the Great Lakes Basin using a collaborative to support the GLRI. This information would support invasive species monitoring, wetland inventory, and habitat restoration. USGS will work with the Great Lakes Observing System and other data sharing efforts to make USGS geospatial information readily accessible to researchers and the public. Working with county governments, the State of Michigan, and other Federal Agencies, particularly the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Geological Survey will endeavor to acquire high-resolution elevation and LiDAR point-cloud data for (in order of priority): Macomb County, St. Clair County, and Monroe County, Michigan. Data will be acquired based on a standard USGS specification requiring 2 meter maximum sample spacing, 15cm maximum vertical error, as well as several interpreted products. The contract will be handled by the USGS National Geospatial Technical Operations Center (NGTOC) Commercial Partnerships Team (CPT) based in Rolla Missouri. The NGTOC will be reimbursed at a rate of between 5 and 10% for labor associated with contract management, administration, and QA/QC of the products. The rapidly deteriorating budget situation for local governments in Southeast Michigan has called into question the availability of local matching funds. In the absence of local matching funds, data sharing agreements will be negotiated with the counties to make locally maintained geospatial data available to scientists and the general public. Priority will be given first to HEC counties, then counties contributing to the HEC, and finally other counties in the Lake Erie Basin that have not been flown.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Objectives/Scope<\/h4> Complete LiDAR coverage for the Huron-Erie Corridor. Depending on funds actually available or obtained through partnerships, expand to finish the Lake Erie watershed. Make all of this data available to scientists, managers, State/County/Local agencies, and the general public.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Relevance/Benefits<\/h4> LiDAR is a critical data need for many Federal, State, and local agencies, as well as environmental managers and researchers. Much of the elevation data in the Great Lakes, and within the western Lake Erie watershed, is more than 30 years old. In regions of modest relief, such as the lake plains of Monroe and Macomb County, MI, the existing 30m DEM and 10ft contours are both outdated and lack sufficient detail to identify areas of current or potential wetlands, develop restoration and management plans, or even delineate watersheds reliably. Further, the additional derivative products of the LiDAR, including land cover, canopy height, and biomass, among others, provide useful information for restoration.\n<br /> \n<br /> Large, consolidated purchases through established contract vehicles minimizes the data cost per unit area, while assuring a high level of standardization and compatibility. The USGS has been a leader in this field for two decades, and has ongoing relationships with partners flying areas ranging in size from individual counties to the state of Iowa.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Approach<\/h4> Working with county governments, the State of Michigan, and other Federal Agencies, particularly the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Geological Survey will endeavor to acquire high-resolution elevation and LiDAR point-cloud data for (in order of priority): Macomb County, St. Clair County, and Monroe County, Michigan.

If so, this will allow better coverage of the 2nd and 3rd priority areas.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Products/Communications<\/h4> In terms of planning and managing the project, communications will be primarily between USGS Liaisons and county partners, or Federal partners.\n<br /> \n<br /> The Federal collaborators on the 2011 remote sensing plan have developed a white paper for GLNPO. This white paper has been provided for review and comment, and will likely be revised to address concerns or comments GLNPO may have. The intent of that document is explain both the GLNPO and to watchdog groups the different remote sensing technologies being employed in several templates, and express how these various efforts complement each other, rather than compete.\n<br /> \n<br /> A fact sheet will be developed in conjunction with the EROS Data Center based on data for Wayne Co, MI (about to be delivered 12/2009) illustrating the improvements possible in watershed delineation, hydrologic routing, and land cover classification based on LiDAR, as well as examples of several additional analyses, such as cut-fill, canopy closure, and biomass estimates.\n<br /> \n<br /> Following production of the data, in conjunction with partnering local and regional agencies, we can do a press release and a demonstration of identifying a wetland based on the LiDAR and imagery (from a separate funding source) we will be partnering on in the Detroit area. The biggest opportunity may not be until 2011, when new topographic maps will be produced with the new data.\n<br /> &nbsp;",

Algal feeding attractants were injected at predetermined locations in the backwater to attract and concentrate Asian carp in the closed portion of the backwater. Nine days after the first algal feeding attractant was added, a water gun barrier was established at the narrowest location on the backwater. The water gun barrier was established about 14 hours before commercial fishers began 3 consecutive days of carp removal; the water gun barrier operated continuously throughout commercial fishing. The presence of fish near the water gun barrier was assessed by hydroacoustics aligned around the barrier. Five commercial fishers daily fished in predetermined zones within the backwater. Hydroacoustic surveys, algal feeding attractant injection and water gun barrier operation continued throughout the commercial fishing period. Fish harvest (species and size) was recorded for each fisher by location and date. The change in fish distribution within the backwater as a function of algal feeding, water gun barrier operation and commercial fishing pressure and the presence of fish near the water gun barrier was assessed.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Relevance/Benefits<\/h4> The goal of this work was to evaluate an approach to integrating various potential controls to make Asian carp control more effective and efficient.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Key Findings<\/h4> \n<ul> \n <li>Commercial fishing efforts removed approximately 14,700 pounds of bighead carp and silver carp.<\/li> \n <li>Asian carp catch rates decreased in at least two of the five fishing zones.<\/li> \n <li>Hydroacoustic data analysis is in progress to determine whether the distribution of fish changed in response to adding algal feeding attractants, water gun barrier operation and commercial fishing.<\/li> \n<\/ul> &nbsp; \n<h4>Products<\/h4> Midwest Fish and Wildlife Conference, Asian Carp Symposia, January 29, 2014.

        "purpose": "Multiple investigations are developing methods to manage invasive bighead carps and silver carps spreading through the Mississippi River basin and threatening to invade other drainage basins. This project sought to integrate several of those methods to increase removal of bighead carp and silver carp from a backwater along the Illinois River near Morris, IL and to demonstrate the integration of those methods to fishery managers.",

        "body": "<h4>Description of Work<\/h4> Bighead, silver and grass carp larvae were raised in the laboratory. Larvae were observed during the hatching process. Recently hatched larvae were placed in 10 feet tall clear vertical containers where the carp were exposed to light for a similar amount of time during the day as they would experience in a river during the spawning period. Depth selection, swimming behavior, and swimming speed were observed in both day and night periods.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Relevance/Benefits<\/h4> Understanding the stage at which Asian carps begin swimming is critical to development of models that predict whether a river is adequate for reproduction by Asian carps. Knowledge of where and how Asian carp larvae arrive in nursery areas is required to focus efforts on destruction of the larvae and juveniles. Furthermore, knowledge of depth selection and swimming speed are needed to enhance early detection efforts based on egg and larvae detection.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Key Findings<\/h4> \n<ul> \n <li>Bighead and silver carps swam vigorously immediately after hatching, but only vertically. Fish swam vigorously almost straight upwards<\/li> \n <li>Horizontal swimming began at a developmental stage coinciding with the development of the gas bladder. At gas bladder inflation, they were capable of holding their position in the water without swimming or vigorous directional swimming.<\/li> \n <li>Gas bladder emergence also corresponds to the youngest life stages appearing in off-channel nursery environments, in another USGS study. This indicates that carps choose to move toward nursery habitats, and provides information necessary to deploy control efforts directed at larvae and juvenile carps.<\/li> \n <li>Prior to gas bladder inflation, larvae used the entire water column for their upward swimming then sinking behavior. After gas bladder inflation, larvae concentrated near the surface in daylight periods, but spread through the water column at night. This is an indication that surface plankton tows in the daylight period would be most successful for early detection of young Asian carp in nursery habitats.<\/li> \n<\/ul>",
        "purpose": "Prior to this work, very little was known about the behavior of Asian carp larvae, and most of what was previously believed has been disproven. The eggs of Asian carps drift in the current and if they settle to the bottom they are believed to perish. The length of river required for Asian carp reproduction can be determined using this required drift period. It was believed that the larvae would also be subject to this requirement until they reached a developmental stage capable of swimming. Additionally, Asian carp larvae are known to appear in wetland nursery environments but it was unclear if the fish were washed there or if they arrived through their own locomotive abilities. Knowledge of where and how Asian carp larvae arrive in nursery areas is required to focus efforts on destruction of the larvae and juveniles. Furthermore, knowledge of depth selection and swimming speed are needed to enhance early detection efforts based on egg and larvae detection.",

The plankton (phytoplankton and zooplankton) Beneficial Use Impairment (BUI) was so designated because impairment metrics were unavailable or inconclusive. Recent investigations, however, suggest that plankton communities are relatively healthy and no longer threaten the local ecosystem. Thus, the BUI for plankton may now be outdated in all, or parts of, the St. Lawrence River in the Massena AOC. The primary goal for the Massena (and Cornwall) Remedial Action Plan (RAP) (developed by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC), the Massena Citizen Advisory Committee (CAC), the Canadian governments, the Cornwall Public Advisory Committee (PAC), and the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe at Akwesasne) is to &quot;restore, protect, and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the St. Lawrence River ecosystem and in particular the Akwesasne, Cornwall-Lake St.Francis and Massena Area of Concern in accordance with the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement and other agency laws, regulations, and policies&quot;. The RAP established specific criteria in the St. Lawrence River at Massena AOC for delisting (restoring and protecting) the &quot;Degradation of Phytoplanton and Zooplankton Populations&quot; BUI. These criteria are: (1) &quot;phytoplankton or zooplankton community structure does not significantly differ from unimpacted control sites of comparable physical and chemical characteristics&quot;, and (2) &quot;in the absence of community structure data, plankton bioassays confirm no toxicity impact in ambient waters (i.e. no growth inhibition)&quot;. This study generated toxicity data needed to test hypotheses that (1) waters at all sample locations in the AOC are not toxic to plankton and (2) the toxicity of waters at all sample locations in the AOC are no more toxic to plankton than are waters from upstream control reaches (in three selected main tributaries and in the St. Lawrence River), which are not within the AOC. Toxicity of waters to plankton from all study sites will be quantified by the (a) growth of the green algae species, Selenastrum capricornutum and (b) reproductive capacity (and survival) of Ceriodaphnia dubia using standard United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) guidelines. Statistical analyses that test both hypotheses will be used to determine if waters within the St. Lawrence River at Massena AOC meet the second criterion for delisting the plankton BUI.\n<br /> &nbsp;",
        "purpose": "The objective of this study is to determine if the phytoplankton and zooplankton beneficial use is impaired, or not impaired, in parts, or all of the St. Lawrence River at Massena AOC. Plankton toxicity data will be used, specifically, to test whether waters in this AOC meet established criteria for delisting the plankton BUI.",

        "body": "<h4>Description of Work<\/h4> The main objective of this project is to identify locations within the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers that provide the best opportunities for remediation of fish spawning and nursery habitats, with the ultimate goal of enhancing native fish populations. Information about existing river habitat, current patterns, fish nursery areas, movements, spawning, and early life habitat requirements are being used in adaptive management models to identify areas suitable for creation or restoration of fish habitats. Physical and biological information are being coupled to show where and how habitat restoration will produce the strongest benefits to native fishes at multiple locations in the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers. This project also addresses AOC delisting goals in the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers by mapping current areas of fish habitat, identifying sites for habitat restoration, and examining connectivity to surrounding habitats.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Relevance/Benefits<\/h4> This project is remediating some of the effects of development (e.g., shoreline hardening, channelization, infilling of wetlands) over the last century on native fish species and their habitats in the HEC. Scientists are identifying remaining habitat fragments and new areas where habitat restoration could produce self-sustaining populations of native fishes. Information gained from previous research conducted by the USGS Great Lakes Science Center and partners in the Detroit River resulted in the construction of two fish spawning reefs that are used by at least 14 species of native fish, including economically important walleye and lake sturgeon (threatened in Michigan and Ontario). This project builds upon previous work by expanding the spatial scope of restoration to include the St. Clair River and Lake St. Clair. Habitat assessment and restoration techniques developed in the HEC through this project could be applied to other Great Lakes connecting channels, such as the St. Marys and Niagara Rivers, and the Welland Canal. To ensure that information generated through this project is accessible by local communities, an outreach partnership with Michigan Sea Grant has been developed. Ultimately, this work will enhance ecologically and economically valuable fish populations in the HEC, and contribute to the revitalization of the region.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Key Findings<\/h4> The USGS conducted intensive surveys in the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers in 2010-2012 to assess the extent of fish spawning and nursery habitat use. Data gathered from these surveys were used in geographic, hydrodynamic models that predicted lake sturgeon, walleye, and lake whitefish spawning areas that would be suitable for spawning reef construction. The USGS continued to measure the extent of fish spawning and abundance of larval fishes in 2012 at more than 20 sites in the Detroit River and western Lake Erie. Ongoing sampling at these sites is providing information on the timing and spatial distribution of fish spawning, fish eggs, and larvae necessary for restoration efforts. Restored habitats are attracting numerous fish, including multiple threatened species, showing proof-of-concept for this science-guided restoration project. Since 2010, nine Northern madtoms have been captured in the Detroit River. Madtoms are endangered in Michigan and Ontario and are considered globally rare. Assessment data have revealed that madtoms use the constructed reefs created in the Detroit River. Additionally, multiple lake sturgeon in spawning condition were collected on restored habitats. The first collection of juvenile lake sturgeon was made in the Detroit River during 2010, suggesting successful spawning of sturgeon on restored habitat. Juvenile lake herring were also collected in the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers during 2011 and 2012.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Products<\/h4> The USGS, in collaboration with management agency partners, began developing a&nbsp;conservation action plan&nbsp;during 2012 to provide a fine-scale assessment of the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers. The conservation action plan will identify knowledge gaps and aid in future monitoring and the prioritization of restoration efforts within the system.\n<br /> &nbsp;",
        "purpose": "The Huron-Erie Corridor (HEC) is the connecting channel between Lake Huron and Lake Erie, including the St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, Detroit River, and western Lake Erie. The HEC contains the largest freshwater delta in the Great Lakes, supports over 65 species of fish, 16 of which are classified as threatened or endangered, and is one of the busiest navigation centers in the United States. Historically, the HEC supported a highly productive fishery, providing spawning and nursery habitat for 80 fishery species, including lake trout, lake sturgeon, lake whitefish, lake herring, walleye, and yellow perch. Unfortunately, over the last century, fish productivity in the HEC has been dramatically reduced due to construction of shipping channels, which severely altered fish spawning grounds and nursery habitats. The goal of this GLRI project is to enhance native fish populations through restoration of fish spawning and nursery habitats in the HEC and St. Clair and Detroit Rivers Areas of Concern (AOCs). The USGS is providing vital information to define restoration targets in AOCs, and is measuring restoration success through pre- and post-habitat construction assessments. This work is being completed as part of the greater Huron-Erie Corridor Initiative (http://huron-erie.org/), a highly collaborative initiative started in 2004 by the USGS Great Lakes Science Center and over 20 partners to restore habitats and native fish and wildlife species in the corridor, ultimately providing societal, economic, and environmental benefits to the Great Lakes region.",

        "body": "<h4>Description of Work<\/h4> The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) was established to accelerate ecosystem restoration in the Great Lakes by confronting the most serious threats to the region, such as nonpoint source pollution, toxic sediments, and invasive species. Three Priority Watersheds have been targeted by the Regional Working Group's Phosphorus Reduction Work Group (Fox/Green Bay, Saginaw, and Maumee) and are characterized by having a high density of agricultural land use and have ecosystem impairments that have been clearly identified. Within the Fox River Priority Watershed, monitoring is being conducted at the sub-watershed and edge-of-field scale. The edge-of-field stations are targeted to those areas within each watershed that will be directly affected by the conservation efforts. These sites will allow for a rapid assessment of conservation implementation as the water quality from those locations are immediately affected by land-use and management changes and represent the major pathways for non-point pollution to enter the stream. Relationships between the smaller to sub-watershed scale will help develop an understanding on how conservation efforts may impact the watershed as a whole. This effort will accelerate quantification of current and ongoing efforts in the Lower Fox GLRI Priority subwatershed with a focus on the smallest scale of implementation (field scale) and is responsive to RWG questions/requests regarding the need to quantify impacts of priority GLRI activities through relevant science and monitoring. USGS will undertake and coordinate a multi-agency effort to predict losses of phosphorus, nitrogen, and sediment from individual fields using established water quality monitoring networks and simulation tools. Results may be scaled-up to examine broader scale effects and reasonable/achievable reductions that can be expected from targeted activities. Coordination among scientists, water quality specialists, and modelers in NRCS, USGS, EPA, and partnering universities is expected. Linkages between this work and ongoing Great Lakes efforts to establish target loads for subwatersheds (e.g., Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement) will be explored.\n<br /> &nbsp;",
        "purpose": "Monitoring at the priority watershed scale will provide a direct measure of the effects of USDA conservation practice implementations on reducing erosion and nutrients by targeting those areas affected by the conservation practice. This study will also provide data to verify the five year average annual loading targets of soluble reactive phosphorus as described in the Great Lakes Action Plan.",

It was designed to help Great Lakes researchers and managers strategically plan, implement, and analyze monitoring and restoration activities by providing easy access to historical and on-going project metadata while allowing them to identify gaps (spatially and topically) that have been underrepresented in previous efforts or need further study. SiGL provides a user-friendly and efficient way to explore Great Lakes projects and data through robust search options while also providing a critical spatial perspective through its interactive mapping interface.\n<br /> &nbsp;\n<br /> SiGL consists of three core applications:\n<br /> \n<br /> 1. The public SiGL mapper (wim.usgs.gov/SiGL)\n<br /> \n<br /> 2. The SiGL database, which contains all project and site information that is available through the mapper\n<br /> \n<br /> 3. The SiGL Data Management System (DMS), which allows data managers to create, upload, and edit their project and site information\n<br /> \n<br /> \n<span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0)\">As of Nov. 10, 2014, SiGL contains 257 projects (50 with monitoring sites, 207 without) and over 8,000 monitoring sites. This represents over 75 different agencies and organizations (including 16 USGS science centers and programs) throughout all five Great Lakes.<\/span>\n<br /> &nbsp;",
        "purpose": "In the Great Lakes basin, there are numerous organizations and agencies undertaking scientific monitoring and research activities with the goal of evaluating current threats and identifying management strategies that will restore and protect the Great Lakes? ecosystem and resources. The GLRI Action plan identifies a multi-step science-based adaptive management cycle that outlines the process for guiding these actions. But this process relies on a thorough understanding of historical and current activities, as well as clear communication of the progress and results of these efforts. Having a centralized place where researchers and managers can go to identify relevant scientific activities and gather basic information about a project?s breadth and scope is crucial. \n\nThe Science in the Great Lakes Mapper (SiGL) was created just for this purpose. It can capture information about any scientific activity (both current and historical), give details on how to access the data and results from those projects, and provide contact information for the principal investigators. Additionally, SiGL provides a user-friendly and efficient way to explore Great Lakes projects and datasets through robust search options while providing an interactive spatial experience through its mapping interface.",

        "body": "<h4>Description of Work<\/h4> U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) will identify through this project significant sources and impacts of historical and newly emerging toxics to the Great Lakes ecosystem through broad surveillance as well as laboratory and field research of tree swallows and other bird species. USGS scientists will determine the amount of exposure to and the effects of historical and emerging contaminants in Great Lakes food chains. The data will inform regulators and provide guidance on removal of Beneficial Use Impairments at Area of Concern sites around the Great Lakes. Work supported under this project is quantifying exposure to, and effects of, both historical and emerging contaminants on Great Lakes food chains using sentinel indicator species such as colonial waterbirds and tree swallows. Results will contribute directly to assessments of Great Lakes ecosystem health and science-based decision making, provide data that will be directly used by States and EPA to assess whether specific BUIs can be removed and AOC?s subsequently delisted, provide a baseline for future trend analysis, and determine the effectiveness of recent remediation actions at AOCs and other known hotspots. The tree swallow data provide for a biological matrix that is consistent across all AOCs and allows direct comparisons among AOCs and comparisons to non-AOC locations across not only the Great Lakes, but also the northern tier of states in the U.S. as well as Canada. Because swallows can be enticed to nest at AOCs with the use of nest boxes, similar data will be available for all AOCs. Because there are effects thresholds already established for tree swallows, or other avian species, it can be determined directly whether exposures to contaminants of various chemical classes are at or above levels of concern. The collection of colonial waterbird data, where those species occur, in conjunction with the tree swallow data, will allow for modeling and assessment of possible contaminant effects throughout the aquatic ecosystem. The limited feeding radius of swallows and close ties to sediment contamination allow for an assessment of the biological availability of sediment contaminants as well as quantification of changes in sediment contamination that will be directly usable by EPA in remedy effectiveness assessments.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Relevance/Benefits<\/h4> This information on effects of those chemical contaminants is directly applicable to two Beneficial Use Impairments (BUIs) for wildlife and is being used by States and EPA in their BUI assessments and reports. This information can also be used by decision makers to further prioritize watersheds for restoration, and is providing important metrics to measure the success of restoration and remediation activities that are ongoing or planned. Comparisons among sites, as well as to sites across the U.S. and Canada, will allow for better and more rigorous assessments of the effects of chemical contaminants on the health of the Great Lakes as a whole and at individual AOCs. This project is being conducted in close collaboration with EPA, NOAA, FWS, and State governments. By the end of this project, the resulting data set will be among the most comprehensive available for avian contaminants in a specific geographic region. A partnership has been initiated among EPA (ORD, Cincinnati, OH); USGS, Fort Collins, CO; and USGS, UMESC, WI to evaluate trophic level responses to PCB contamination at two AOCs (Manistique, MI and Ottawa River, OH). This partnership will enhance our ability to project exposure and effects throughout the food web and to provide additional information and techniques applicable to other AOCs.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Key Findings<\/h4> Work funded during the first 3 years of the study has provided valuable and heretofore unavailable information, quantifying the distribution of both organic and inorganic contaminants in the same matrix (tree swallow eggs) across all AOCs and nearby reference areas. To date, detailed information has been collected at 45 study sites encompassing AOCs across all Great Lakes. EPA scientists (ORD, Athens, GA) completed metabolomic analyses of tree swallow tissues collected in 2011 by Project 80. Organic analyses from 2012 collections were completed and results are being converted to usable formats. Preliminary summaries of 2012 information have been made available to State AOC coordinators and public advisory organizations including the Fox River/Green Bay AOC, Waukegan AOC, Niagara River AOC, Menominee River AOC, Saginaw River AOC, Manistique River AOC, and Sheboygan River AOC\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Products<\/h4> The \n<strong>web site<\/strong> established for GLRI Project 80: ( \n<a href=\"http://www.umesc.usgs.gov/wildlife_toxicology/glri_project80.html\">http://www.umesc.usgs.gov/wildlife_toxicology/glri_project80.html<\/a>).\n<br /> \n<br /> A \n<strong>summary <\/strong>of Project 80 results was presented on the Huron-Erie Corridor Research vessel meeting in August 2012.

        "purpose": "Results will contribute directly to assessments of Great Lakes ecosystem health and science-based decision making, provide data that directly contribute to BUI removal and AOC delisting assessments, provide a baseline for future trend analysis, and determine the effectiveness of recent remediation actions at AOCs and other known hotspots.  Specifically, all of the tree swallow and colonial waterbird data can be used directly by States and EPA to determine whether two BUIs ? (1) Bird or Animal Deformities or Reproductive Problems and (2) Degradation of Fish and Wildlife Populations ? can be removed.  These data are being provided to States and EPA in a format and style that enable their immediate and efficient use.  The tree swallow data can also be used in the remedy effectiveness context, directly and immediately, at those locations when remedies have already been implemented.  Concentrations in tree swallow tissues are being measured pre- and post-dredging to assess remedy effectiveness for biological endpoints.",

We will measure the amount of Asian carp eDNA in water samples. The amount of eDNA will be related to the numbers of eggs and larvae counted in matched samples (water samples taken at the same time and place). The time since the eDNA was released by the carp will be estimated and these results will be related to the average age of AC eggs and larvae in matched samples. We will also test for substances which interfere with the eDNA measurement techniques and can lead to false negatives.\n<br /> \n<br /> We will also be validating markers developed by USGS and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) as part of an inter-laboratory validation study coordinated by USGS and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) Whitney Genetics Laboratory. A suite of new markers will be evaluated for incorporation by the FWS into its eDNA surveillance program. One potential marker is a USGS-designed allelic discrimination marker which can detect the DNA of bighead carp and silver carp in a single sample, potentially reducing by half the number of analyses required.\n<br /> \n<br /> Additionally, samples will be processed from multiple environments to assess the utility of the MST-developed markers for bacteria specific to Asian carp. Pending these analyses, MST-specific markers will be validated for potential incorporation in eDNA surveillance programs.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Relevance/Benefits<\/h4> This project builds on our previous successes at understanding eDNA in a laboratory setting, and will extend that work into the field. Results from the spawning study will have relevance for prediction of population sizes and identification of spawning areas and spawning events. Newly developed methods will help identify the age of eDNA in a sample, and this will be useful in predicting whether the eDNA came from a live fish rather than a carcass or waste from a fish-eating bird. We will also develop methods to detect the effects of substances which mask the presence of eDNA in environmental samples used in monitoring; this effort is vital to avoid false negatives in monitoring samples. Overall, our results will lead to better interpretation of eDNA detections and better enable determination of the linkage between detected DNA in environmental samples and the presence of live fish.\n<br /> \n<br /> \n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/projects/invasive_species/images/10-improving-asian-carpeDNA-techniques-A-10.jpg\" />\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Key Findings<\/h4> \n<ul> \n <li>In fish kept in tanks in the laboratory, the amount of eDNA can predict the population density (g/L) of fish in the water, within a factor of 10.<\/li> \n <li>Temperature did not change eDNA amounts, but feeding increased eDNA in water from tanks of Asian carp, suggesting that outside of the spawning season, most eDNA comes from intestinal wall cells that are shed in feces.<\/li> \n <li>In a laboratory experiment, most eDNA from sperm in the water was rapidly degraded within a couple days, but a small fraction persisted for at least a few weeks.<\/li> \n <li>Substances present in some water samples can mask the presence of eDNA. With partners at the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, we are developing methods to detect inhibition.<\/li> \n <li>Fish-eating birds shed silver carp DNA in their waste for up to 1 week following a single meal of silver carp.<\/li> \n <li>Silver carp DNA in fish-eating bird waste or in slime of silver carp deposited on metal sheets persisted for &gt;28 d despite being exposed to temperatures &gt;30&deg;C and natural sunlight conditions.<\/li> \n <li>USGS coordinated an inter-laboratory validation study with FWS and USACE that validated a new eDNA extraction kit. The kit is now in use by the FWS-Whitney Genetics Laboratory to process samples for the FWS eDNA surveillance program. The new extraction kit costs ~75% less than the old kit, takes less time to use and extracts more DNA than the previous kit.<\/li> \n <li>Multiple new markers have been designed for the detection of the DNA of bighead carp and silver carp including a new allelic discrimination marker and a series of increasing length ?stair-step? markers. These new markers will be validated in 2014.<\/li> \n <li>Long sequences (&gt;1300 bp) of silver carp were only detected following a spawning event on the Wabash River, suggesting that DNA sequences rapidly degrade to fragments &lt;1300 bp. Understanding the degradation pattern of DNA could be extremely useful to the interpretation of eDNA detections.<\/li> \n<\/ul> &nbsp; \n<h4>Products<\/h4> \n<a href=\"http://www.asiancarp.us/documents/ECALSloadingreportJuly2013.pdf\">Part 1 of report&nbsp;on ECALS studies of factors affecting eDNA shedding rates<\/a>\n<br /> \n<br /> \n<a href=\"http://www.asiancarp.us/documents/ECALSSheddingStudies.pdf\">Part 2 of report&nbsp;on ECALS studies of factors affecting eDNA shedding rates<\/a>\n<br /> \n<br /> Manuscript&nbsp;on eDNA shedding rates to be published in Summer 2014\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<ul> \n <li>Advancements in Markers for the Detection of Bigheaded Carp DNA from Environmental Samples<\/li> \n <li>Microbial Source Tracking and Its Potential to Assist eDNA Assay for Asian Carp Monitoring<\/li> \n<\/ul> \n<br /> Oral presentation ?DNA shedding rates of Asian Carps, for use in understanding field collections of environmental DNA.?\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<ul> \n <li>2013 International Conference on Aquatic Invasive Species; Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada<\/li> \n <li>2013 International Association for Great Lakes Research; West Lafayette, IN<\/li> \n <li>2013 International Congress for Conservation Biology; Baltimore, MD<\/li> \n <li>2013 American Fisheries Society; Little Rock, AR<\/li> \n<\/ul>",
        "purpose": "Environmental DNA (eDNA) has become a vital tool for early detection of invasive Asian carp, including bighead carp (BHC) and silver carp (SVC). eDNA is genetic material from cells shed from fish into the water, and can include skin cells, intestinal cells, and sperm and eggs. eDNA can also come from fish carcasses in the water, from boats and fishing gear that have been used in areas with Asian carp, and from waste from animals that have eaten the fish. Our previous work has shown that the amount of eDNA in the water increases with the amount of fish, that feeding the fish increases eDNA, that most eDNA from sperm in the water degrades within a couple days but some stays in the water for at least a few weeks. We have also found other ways that eDNA enters the water including via fish-eating birds (bald eagles, cormorants, pelicans) that shed silver carp eDNA in their waste, , or in fish slime deposited on metal surfaces which was found to persist for at least 28 days. The presence, relative quantity and quality of silver carp eDNA in the Wabash River (Indiana) was also characterized in response to the movement of telemetry tagged fish.\n\nFurther, studies were completed to compare the microbes present in the digestive tracts of gizzard shad and silver carp ? known as microbial source tracking (MST); it is similar to eDNA but focuses on the detection of a bacteria unique to the target species instead of the eDNA of the target species. Bacteria unique to silver carp were identified which may allow the use of MST to supplement surveillance of Asian carp eDNA. \n\nThis year (2014) we will focus on the validation of new genetic markers for use in eDNA monitoring programs, data development to determine the applicability of MST within eDNA surveillance programs, and characterize the eDNA that comes from Asian carp spawning in the Missouri River, where they are already established. Our studies focus on improving the usefulness of eDNA monitoring to managers working to stop the spread of Asian carp.",

However, the chronic toxicity of organic chemicals has only been evaluated with a limited number of mussel species or for a limited number of organic chemicals. The objective of this study will be to evaluate methods for conducting 90-d water only exposures with juvenile mussels and conducted chronic 28-d toxicity tests with at least organic chemicals of concern and two commonly tested species of mussels (Lampsilis siliquoidea, fatmucket and Villosa iris, rainbow mussel). If additional funding is available in FY14, two additional chemicals will be tested. Selection of the three organic chemicals to be tested will be decided based on a review of the literature, on the results of ongoing acute toxicity testing of mussels and snails at USGS-Columbia with up to 20 chemicals of concern, and on consultations with USEPA Region 5. Candidate organic chemicals might include pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or polychlorinated biphenyls.\n<br /> &nbsp;",

This information will help guide restoration efforts to achieve maximum effectiveness and success. Project provides unified information across the Great Lakes Basin for ecosystem restoration, assessment, and management by incorporating models that relate changes in landscape and hydrologic variables and stresses to changes in ecosystem function. The project relies upon regionally consistent hydrologic, biologic, and geospatial data to generate regionally consistent estimates, models, and analysis. USGS is the Circular A-16 theme lead for hydrographic spatial data. As such USGS has responsibility to coordinate with other federal agencies, states, and other entities the development and stewardship of the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). USGS also has developed in partnership with EPA the NHDPlus, it has a memorandum of understanding with The Nature Conservancy to study environmental flows and impacts of hydrologic alterations on ecology. USGS has been a lead agency in the development of techniques and methods to estimate streamflow characteristics in gaged and ungaged watersheds and in developing, applying, and coordinating research in ecology and hydroecology. Products from this research will include a consistent hydrologic dataset of the US Great Lakes Basin built on the 1:100,000 NHDplus and attributed with landscape and aquatic ecologic variables. Empirical models developed for fish distribution, temperature, and streamflow will be developed. A hierarchical lotic habitat classification framework and fish-based lotic habitat classification will be built on the hydrologic dataset.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Relevance/Benefits<\/h4> Project provides unified information across the Great Lakes Basin for ecosystem restoration, assessment, and management by incorporating models that relate changes in landscape and hydrologic variables and stresses to changes in ecosystem function.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Key Findings<\/h4> Scientists updated the AFINCH analysis program to improve the ability of the analyst to archive and reproduce simulation results. The AFINCH analysis program is menu-driven, and, prior to this update, reproducing simulations would require the analyst to read through a log file written by the program and manually inputting the required information into the AFINCH program again. The program was updated to write and read an XML file that archives both the user input values and the AFINCH program regression results. Reproducing a simulation is streamlined as an analyst can now provide the XML file to the program to quickly set up the simulation and read the required information. The analyst can also verify that the reproduced simulation results match the original simulation. Project researchers worked with the USGS Center for Integrated Data Analytics (CIDA) to develop an on-line mapper that will deliver the time series of ungaged flow estimates produced by AFINCH to the public. Initial versions of the software have been developed and these will be refined during the remainder of FY13. Preliminary relations describing fish species response to altered streamflow also were developed. These relations will be refined as AFINCH flow estimates are finalized.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Products<\/h4> A \n<strong>mapping tool<\/strong> was developed, which allows users to explore and download gaged stream flow as well as modeled stream flow and catchment yield from AFINCH. The GLRI AFINCH Mapper Tool is available at \n<a href=\"http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/afinch/\">http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/afinch/<\/a>\n<br /> &nbsp;",
        "purpose": "Two objectives from this focus area benefit from this research.  The ungaged flow estimates provide key information for assessing tributary streamflow within the Basin.  The major purpose of this work is to provide a common, consistent, framework for stream ecosystem restoration and management.  This framework can be used to assess the health of aquatic ecosystems, provide tools for use in stream ecosystem and watershed restoration, planning, and management; help identify areas in need of protection, conservation, enhancement, and restoration; and provide information for policy makers to make informed decisions on topics that relate to stream ecosystem health.",

        "body": "<h4>Description of Work<\/h4> A Department of Interior team, including U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and National Park Service (NPS), is working to determine why botulism outbreaks, which have killed large numbers of fish and fish-eating birds, are occurring in the Great Lakes. This project will determine: 1) a quick assay test for the presence of the toxin , 2) how birds are exposed to the toxins, and 3) what factors combined trigger an outbreak. This information will be used to formulate management strategies. Botulism intoxication is caused by ingestion of neurotoxins produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. Periodic outbreaks of type E botulism have resulted in die-offs of fish and fish-eating birds in the Great Lakes since at least the 1960s, but outbreaks have become more common and widespread since 1999. Botulism has been responsible for over 100,000 bird deaths on the Great Lakes since 1999, and extensive bird mortality in northern Lake Michigan near Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore (SLBE; over 4150 birds in 2007) received widespread press attention and caused great public concern. The actual sites of toxin exposure for birds remain unknown. Spores of C. botulinum are naturally widely distributed in the environment, but toxin production occurs only when suitable environmental conditions allow spore germination and cell growth, and this may be related to local soil and water conditions. The physical and ecological factors that are associated with toxin production, waterbird exposure, and botulism outbreaks are poorly understood in the Great Lakes, as in other environments. Invasive species, particularly dreissenid mussels Dreissena spp. and round gobies Neogobius melanostomus, have been implicated in the recent increased occurrence of botulism mortality in Great Lakes fish and birds, but this has not been proven. Dreissenid mussels may enhance nearshore algal growth, and decomposing algae may help create the anoxic conditions required for C. botulinum germination. We hypothesize that recent increases in the incidence of type E avian botulism outbreaks in the Great Lakes may be associated with the presence of large amounts of decomposing sloughed Cladophora. We propose to determine the presence or absence of C. botulinum and type E botulinum toxin in sediments. In FY 2013, targeted sampling sites will be chosen in northern Lake Michigan near SLBE to represent sites that support varying amounts of sloughed Cladophora at a range of depths throughout the season.We further propose to use population surveys to assess waterbird distribution, with emphasis on species historically impacted by type E botulism (e.g., Common Loon Gavia immer), to examine the spatial relationships between bird distribution and carcass detection of confirmed botulism mortalities, and to analyze the relation between botulism in birds and environmental conditions at locations where toxin exposure is likely to occur.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Relevance/Benefits<\/h4> Botulinum toxin is the most toxic natural substance on earth. Botulism has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of fish and birds in the Great Lakes since 1999, including federally endangered Piping Plovers and imperiled lake sturgeon. The proliferation of botulism in the Great Lakes represents a serious challenge to Great Lakes restoration efforts. Through this GLRI-funded project, the USGS is bringing together scientists with diverse areas of expertise to address botulism outbreaks in the Great Lakes. This team of experts is taking a comprehensive approach to understanding what factors need to link together to trigger a botulism outbreak, and how future outbreaks can be predicted and prevented in the Great Lakes. Scientists are developing methods to detect the presence of botulinum toxin in the environment and determining how the botulinum toxin reaches bird populations through Great Lakes food webs.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Key Findings<\/h4> GLRI funding is now allowing USGS scientists to make breakthroughs in the prediction and prevention of botulism outbreaks. Scientists have developed and are refining a rapid and cost-effective methodology to detect botulinum toxin. This technology is an important tool that will make assessment of the presence of botulinum toxin much more efficient in the Great Lakes. This technology will also have valuable applications to other systems. This GLRI project is providing critical information toward understanding the factors that promote the proliferation of botulinum toxin in the Great Lakes. The information that this project is generating allows managers to better predict future outbreaks and, ultimately, will allow managers to develop strategies to prevent future outbreaks from occurring, providing great benefits to restoration efforts for the Great Lakes.\n<br /> \n<br /> Sediment samples were collected during 2010-2012 near Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, on Lake Michigan. A total of 435 samples were analyzed for the presence of the botulinum toxin gene. Results from this analysis are used to understand the ways through which birds come into contact with botulinum toxin. A new method to detect botulinum toxin has been developed that performs as well as the ?gold-standard? traditional method. The new method is faster and cheaper than the traditional method, and is a major step forward in the study of botulism. Scientists have learned that avian botulism is the main cause of bird mortality in Lake Michigan. Over 950 sick or dead birds have been collected through this project. Seventy-six birds have been tested for botulinum toxin, of which 42 were positive (55% positive). The distribution and migration of over 175 Common Loons have been tracked to reveal where loons are likely to be exposed to prey fish carrying botulinum toxin.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Products<\/h4> Scientists obtained the first ever \n<strong>dive profiles<\/strong> for loons and have learned that loons dive as deep as 150 feet to feed in Lake Michigan.\n<br /> \n<br /> You can track movements of loons by visiting the USGS loon migration \n<strong>website<\/strong>: ( \n<a href=\"http://www.umesc.usgs.gov/terrestrial/migratory_birds/loons/migrations.html\">http://www.umesc.usgs.gov/terrestrial/migratory_birds/loons/migrations.html<\/a>)\n<br /> \n<br /> A \n<strong>citizen science program<\/strong> (Lake Michigan Volunteer AMBLE: Avian Monitoring for Botulism Lakeshore Events) was established to collect data on bird carcasses that wash ashore near Sleeping Bear Dunes and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and across the lake in Door County, Wisconsin. This team effort has considerably increased our knowledge of the timing, numbers, and species affected by avian botulism.\n<br /> &nbsp;",
        "purpose": "The ultimate goal of this project is to develop management actions to reduce fish and bird mortality during botulism outbreaks.  If, as we suspect, recent increases in botulism outbreaks are due to the presence of large amounts of decomposing algae, the presence of which is due to the effects of dreissenid mussels, then this will represent a reduction in the negative effects of dreissenids on fish and bird populations in the Great Lakes.  However, work funded by this template will gather data that will help reduce the number of beach closure days and will contribute to rapid responses for mock action plans but will not directly meet the measures listed above.",

        "body": "<h4>Description of Work<\/h4> Since 2010, connecting channels have been included in each of the Great Lakes? Lake Management Plans (LaMPs). Lake Ontario now includes both the Niagara River and the St. Lawrence River. The Niagara River is well characterized by a number of long-term programs, but because of the lack of tributary water-quality data, the St. Lawrence River and its tributaries constitute a data gap in the information needed for the Lake Ontario to fulfill its goals. Critical information needs, including basic water-quality parameters, total suspended solids, nutrients and flow data. These data are needed to aid in the identification of sources of nutrient and sediment loading to the St. Lawrence. The monitoring network will consist of seven sites on four rivers (the St. Lawrence and three tributaries: Grass River, Raquette River, and St Regis River), and will include monitoring two locations on the three tributary rivers. In addition, the St. Lawrence River will also be sampled. Four samples will be collected during the first year of monitoring, starting in FY-13. These samples will be scheduled at equal temporal intervals based on beginning date of the project. Comparison of water-quality data from upstream to downstream sites will be useful in assessing the impact of sediment and nutrient sources between these sites. Field, laboratory, and flow parameters will be measured at each site during each visit. Field parameters will be collected at each site and will include pH, temperature, and specific conductance. Samples will be collected and analyzed for Total Suspended Sediment and nutrients: [Ammonia as N, Nitrite, nitrite+nitrate, and Total Nitrogen] and [Orthophosphate (soluble reactive Phosphorous) and Total Phosphorous]. In cases where USGS flow data are not available, flow data will be collected at the site according to USGS protocols. Analytical methods corresponding to those used in the GLRI Lake Ontario tributary sampling being performed by the USGS as part of template 153b in 2012 will be used. One quality assurance sample will be collected per round of sampling; a total of two blanks and two replicates will be collected over the four sampling rounds. Analytical data results will be reported to the EPA using spreadsheets and will also be available through the USGS National Water Quality Information (NWIS) site for the public. These data will be provided within three months of the end of sample collection.\n<br /> &nbsp;",
        "purpose": "In general, the outcomes and outputs will include, but may not be limited to: data relevant to valid assessments of nutrient and sediment loading, monitoring data to support or improve stream restoration projects, and a more robust data set of relevant parameters for the St. Lawrence River and the watershed.",

        "body": "<h4>Description of Work<\/h4> USGS scientists are developing science based forecasting tools that capture changes to water flows and discharges of nutrients and sediments to the Great Lakes. The work done by this project provides managers with forecasting tools for predicting the combined effects of climate and land use changes that will help them identify and prioritize the sites best suited for restoration efforts. USGS scientists will use remote-sensing data to establish a baseline understanding of current distributions of invasive wetland plants and then forecast potential invasion corridors. Alterations to the Great Lakes shoreline or water-level patterns associated with global climate change could have significant impacts on the extent and composition of coastal habitat. Low lake levels can expose fertile wetland bottomlands to invasive species such as common reed ( \n<em>Phragmites<\/em>).\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Objectives/Scope<\/h4> The primary goal is to develop and combine hydrologic models of the Great Lakes Basin suitable for accepting downscaled climate and land-use change inputs, and that produce hydrologic flows suitable for restoration, water quantity, water quality, infrastructure, habitat, and other ecological forecasting. This will facilitate science-based assessments of the impact of climate and land use change on the ecological response at a Great Lakes scale.\n<br /> Specific objectives are as follows:\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<ul> \n <li>Build and calibrate a coarse-scale Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) model of the Lake Michigan Watershed using data from USGS least-impacted stream gages as calibration targets. Develop model calibration methodologies specifically designed to address the ecological and restoration focus of the models.<\/li> \n <li>Evaluate existing evapotranspiration algorithms and develop a new frozen-ground module for the PRMS model.<\/li> \n <li>Simulate impacts of climate change on streams in the Lake Michigan Watershed using down-scaled climate-change predictions from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment report.<\/li> \n <li>Build one fine-scaled PRMS inset model within the framework of the coarse-scale model to investigate local impacts of climate change in areas of interest to stakeholders.<\/li> \n <li>Relate PRMS climate and land-use change flows to SPARROW nutrient loads. Begin work on a TOPMODEL hydrologic flow model of the Great Lakes Basin.<\/li> \n <li>Relate historical wildlife disease data to hydrological indices simulated by the watershed models. Use the relation to forecast changes in disease occurrence and distribution that may result from changes in hydrology due to climate and land-use change.<\/li> \n<\/ul> \n<br /> Questions that will be answered to support restoration in the Great Lakes:&nbsp;The purpose of this project is to answer potential questions about the long-term viability of present day restoration investments given the potential for land use and climate change. Such work helps ensure that public and other funds are not directed to restoration projects that have little likelihood of being self-sufficient and viable over societally relevant time scales. This purpose is important in that it is unlikely future funding will be sufficient to support long-term actively managed restoration activities on the Great Lakes scale.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Approach<\/h4> \n<strong>Objective 1:<\/strong>&nbsp;The U.S. Geological Survey Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) will be used as the basis for the climate change hydrologic modeling. The PRMS model uses hydrologic response units (HRUs) to partition the watershed into areas with relatively uniform hydrologic response. As a pilot for the National Hydrologic Model (NHM), we will work with the MoWS group to develop the coarse-scale model using the NHM framework. At its coarsest resolution, the NHM will be made up of HRUs based on reference stream gages (1000+ reference gages within the U.S. identified by David Wolock to be free of anthropogenic effects). Additional real-world geographic locations, such as outlets of reservoirs, confluences of rivers, etc. will be used to help ensure consistency when nesting model applications. For the Lake Michigan model, this will include stream locations with previous estimates of loading to provide a calibration baseline for climate-change predictions using the SPARROW framework, and all of the tributary streams that flow into the lake.\n<br /> \n<br /> The model will be calibrated using the PEST suite of automated calibration software (Doherty, 2010) using a series of least-impacted USGS stream gages as calibration targets. We will also use large-scale datasets of solar radiation and potential evapotranspiration as calibration targets. A step-wise procedure similar to that described in Hay and others (2006) will be used to perform the calibration. The first three steps for calibration (solar radiation, potential ET, annual water balance) will be carried out for the entire model. The final step (monthly water balance, daily flow targets) will be carried out in parts, defined by sub basins in the model. In cases where sub basins are nested, the upstream sub basin will be calibrated first; the parameters in that sub basin will be fixed, and the next downstream sub basin will be calibrated. This procedure will be continued until the confluence with Lake Michigan is reached.\n<br /> \n<br /> \n<strong>Objective 2:<\/strong>&nbsp;The current version of PRMS has two algorithms for calculating potential evapotranspiration (PET), which may not provide enough spatial variability across large-scale watersheds. Further, both algorithms rely on temperature and solar radiation as inputs, and it is not clear if the parameters calibrated for a particular climate will apply to an altered climate. We will investigate the two PRMS algorithms along with numerous additional algorithms and determine the best approach to be used for current and future climate conditions. The PRMS model will be modified to use the selected algorithm.\n<br /> \n<br /> The current version of PRMS does not consider frozen ground. This could be simply simulated by adjusting soil-property parameters to reflect the hydrologic response to frozen ground. In reality, frozen ground and the interaction of the surface and subsurface flow paths are much more complicated. A frozen ground module will be developed (Andrew Slater, NSIDC) for incorporation into PRMS using a combination of GLRI and MoWS funds.\n<br /> \n<br /> \n<strong>Objective 3:<\/strong>&nbsp;Current efforts for the NHM include developing tools for processing spatial datasets and returning values for selected polygons. There will be several datasets developed with down-scaled climate data culled from the IPCC Fourth Assessment (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2007). The spatial data processing tool will be used to develop an input data set for PRMS with downscaled climate for each model HRU. The Fourth assessment included results from 15 global climate models (GCMs) run for current conditions and three emissions scenarios. The PRMS model will then be run using the various GCM and emissions scenario combinations, and compared to results for the current climate to determine the impacts of climate change on streamflow in the Lake Michigan watershed. It is anticipated that the coarse-scale model will give representative results at a monthly time scale.\n<br /> \n<br /> \n<strong>Objective 4:<\/strong>&nbsp;The first order NHM HRUs will be further discretized into a standalone fine-scale hydrologic model for one area of interest. The area of interest will be selected based on input from stakeholders in the watershed. The PRMS model developed at resolutions finer than the coarse resolution Lake Michigan model will begin by initialization from the set of parameters resulting from calibration in Objective 1. This ensures consistency and quality because the finer resolution model will never have more uncertainty in terms of model misfit compared to the coarse scale model.\n<br /> \n<br /> Anthropogenic factors will be incorporated at the appropriate model resolution. In this manner, the selected higher resolution hydrologic models will be nested within HRUs of coarser resolution hydrologic models. An example of nested scales and model HRUs from the NHM is shown in Figure 2.\n<br /> \n<br /> \n<strong>Objective 5:<\/strong>&nbsp;Develop HydroSPARROW, to estimate nutrient concentrations in streams throughout the Great Lakes Basin and loading to the Great Lakes from each tributary in response to the changes in climate and land use. HydroSPARROW will be an extension of the existing SPARROW model to accommodate changing hydrologic flow. This extension will link the existing SPARROW model with several water-quantity models, including the GIS spatially interpolated model used to estimate streamflow used in the SPARROW model (D. Wolock, USGS, person. commun.) and stand-alone models WATER (based on TOPMODEL) and the PRMS model developed as part of this project. The GIS spatially interpolated model estimates streamflow throughout the basin using flow measured at existing USGS gages assuming a similar yield throughout each basin. WATER and PRMS estimate streamflow throughout the basin on the basis of meteorological forcing, and specific topographic and land cover features, which enable the models to incorporate the effects of various land-use and climate-change scenarios. The introduction of hydrologic flows, and changes to flows, will allow estimates of future nutrient loading using SPARROW-calculated.\n<br /> \n<br /> \n<strong>Objective 6:<\/strong>&nbsp;A pilot effort to relate USGS National Wildlife Health Center data to simulated historical and future change flows will be conducted. Indices of hydrologic alteration metrics will be compared to historical spatial and temporal changes in wildlife disease in the Lake Michigan Basin. From these initial relations, preliminary forecasts of how land and climate changed flows affect wildlife disease can be made. Depending on the explanatory power of the relation, additional ecological metrics may be included in future work.\n<br /> &nbsp;",

The data provide baseline information to assess effectiveness of restoration and land management activities. Thirty of the 59 major downstream flow gages are continuously operating for water-quality samplings at these sites (number of sites reduced to 25 effective June 30, 2013). The work builds on current USGS monitoring efforts and those of partners in the Great Lakes. The results of this effort will provide information on nutrient and sediment loads and measure the effectiveness of restoration efforts in selected tributaries. The USGS nutrient tributary monitoring network follows the National Monitoring Network for Coastal Waters design. Site-specific regression equations are being developed to relate selected laboratory-analyzed analyte concentrations in the discrete samples to measurements recorded by the water-quality monitors. This will enable near-continuous estimates of analytes and allow a reduction in laboratory samples, reducing costs while preserving temporal density of data. This work supports Great Lakes Lakewide Area Management Plans and Remedial Action Plans.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Relevance/Benefits<\/h4> The work builds on current USGS monitoring efforts and those of partners in the Great Lakes. The results of this effort will provide information of current loads and measure the effectiveness of restoration efforts in selected tributaries.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Key Findings<\/h4> One to three years of data is now available depending on the sites. Water samples collected at the 30 tributary monitoring sites include suspended sediment; nutrients; and chloride. One sample per storm event is analyzed for major ions. At each site, monthly base flow samples are being collected, plus up to eight storms, with 6 samples submitted per storm (60 environmental samples per site). Samples are being used to develop statistical relations between continuously measured parameters and lab analyzed parameters. In-situ water-quality sensors deployed at each site measure turbidity, temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and pH every 15 minutes.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Products<\/h4> A preliminary \n<strong>software package<\/strong> for development of statistical models for prediction of nutrient and sediment concentrations using real-time sensors was developed and is being tested. This package will be used for exploration of real-time surrogate models at 30 tributaries for up to 6 parameters per site. These models will help in computation of loadings as well as real-time estimates of parameter concentrations. Surrogate parameters include all data from the in-situ water quality sensors, flow, and seasonal variation. This software package will ultimately increase efficiency of initial development and year-to-year validation or recalibration of the real-time surrogate models. Once the package is finalized this summer, it will also be available as an open-source software package for use in the R-statistical computing environment.\n<br /> &nbsp;",

        "body": "<h4>Description of Work<\/h4> Two large-scale and complex applications of rotenone (a fish poison) in the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS) occurred in 2009 and 2010 to combat invasive Asian. Rotenone is a fish toxicant that targets gill-breathing organisms by inhibiting respiration and breaks down quickly in the environment. In December 2009, rotenone was applied in the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS) at multiple stations through a 6.2-mile reach of the canal near Lockport, Illinois. The rotenone was being applied as a precautionary measure during maintenance of the electric fish barrier in place to keep the Asian carp out of the Great Lakes. Tracking the movement of the rotenone is critical to time the addition of the deactivation chemical to neutralize the toxin. The rotenone plume was encased in Rhodamine WT dye (red in color) so that two survey boats provided real-time feedback to shore personnel regarding the plume extent as it traveled downstream. Real-time tracking of the rotenone was essential in this large-scale application because of the multistage injection strategy and the numerous deactivation points required to minimize collateral damage to fisheries in surrounding and receiving water bodies. A second application of rotenone in May 2010 to the Little Calumet River near O?Brien Lock and Dam (Illinois) provided another opportunity for dye-tracking support operations. In this case, dye was injected at the upstream and downstream boundaries of the rotenone application to track movement of water in and out of a treatment area. This dye tracking allowed proper deactivation to occur and avoided unnecessary damage to fisheries downstream. The data collected during the real-time tracking operations for both rotenone applications is fully documented providing valuable information for future applications.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Relevance/Benefits<\/h4> The methods developed for real-time tracking of piscicides are applicable to tracking virtually any application of toxins or other chemicals used to combat Asian carp or other invasive species. In addition, the methods should prove to be equally successful for tracking of pollutants, contaminants, or water masses in rivers, lakes, and coastal environments.\n<br /> &nbsp; \n<h4>Key Findings<\/h4> Real-time tracking of piscicides can be successfully accomplished, even in water bodies with complex hydrodynamics, using Rhodamine WT dye and surveillance/tracking boats. Such methods minimize collateral damage to fisheries downstream and ensure the toxins are applied in an environmentally responsible manner.\n<br /> &nbsp;",
        "purpose": "Piscicides, or fish poisons, are chemicals that are often used throughout the United States to eradicate invasive fish populations. One of the most common piscicides is rotenone which is not only toxic to the invasive species, but to all fish where it is applied. To ensure that this colorless and odorless chemical only targets fish in the designated treatment reach of a river, the toxin must be deactivated by addition of chemicals downstream. Proper timing of the deactivation requires accurately knowing the location of the toxin plume at all times during the treatment.",
